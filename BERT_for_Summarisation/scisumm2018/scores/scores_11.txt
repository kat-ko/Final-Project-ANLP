The work described here also makes use of a hidden Markov model. In this regard, word equivalence classes were used (Kupiec, 1989). There it is assumed that the distribution of the use of a word depends on the set of categories it can assume, and words are partitioned accordingly. An alternative to uniformly increasing the order of the conditioning is to extend it selectively. Mixed higher- order context can be modeled by introducing explicit state sequences. In this regard, word equivalence classes were used (Kupiec, 1989). There it is assumed that the distribution of the use of a word depends on the set of categories it can assume, and words are partitioned accordingly. In a ranked list of words in the corpus the most frequent 100 words account for approximately 50% of the total tokens in the corpus, and thus data is available to estimate them reliably. The most frequent 100 words of the corpus were assigned individually in the model, thereby enabling them to have different distributions over their categories. Mixed higher- order context can be modeled by introducing explicit state sequences. In the arrangement the basic first-order network remains, permitting all possible category sequences, and modeling first-order dependency. The basic network is then augmented with the extra state sequences which model certain category sequences in more detail. A model containing all of the refinements described, was tested using a magazine article containing 146 sentences (3,822 words). A 30,000 word dictionary was used, supplemented by inflectional analysis for words not found directly in the dictionary. A stochastic method for assigning part-of-speech categories to unrestricted English text has been described.\n Scores', [{'rouge-1': {'f': 0.046204619229051655, 'p': 0.35, 'r': 0.024734982332155476}, 'rouge-2': {'f': 0.006644517089657057, 'p': 0.05263157894736842, 'r': 0.0035460992907801418}, 'rouge-l': {'f': 0.08536585151695425, 'p': 0.35, 'r': 0.04861111111111111}}])
