<q>The compiler allows users to specify finite-state automata and transducers incrementally in a similar fashion to AT&Tâ€™s fsm (Mohri et al., 1997) and Lextools (Sproat, 2003), the Xerox/PARC finite- state toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) and the SFST toolkit (Schmid, 2005).<q>Foma is a finite-state compiler, programming language, and regular expression/finite-state library designed for multipurpose use with explicit support for automata theoretic research, constructing lexical analyzers for programming languages, and building morphological/phonological analyzers, as well as spellchecking applications.
