Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).<q>It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as "antecedent indicators").<q>While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g. neural networks, a situation se­ mantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g. Connoly et al. 1994; Mitkov 1995; Tin & Akman 1995), there is still a strong need for the development of robust and effective strategies to meet the demands of practical NLP systems, and to enhance further the automatic pro­ cessing of growing language resources.
