[CLS] [SEP] Using Random Walks for Question-focused Sentence Retrieval [CLS] [SEP] Our goal is to build a question-focused sentence retrieval mechanism using a topic-sensitive version ofthe LexRank method. [CLS] [SEP] The output of our system, a ranked list of sentences relevant to the userâ€™s question, can be subsequently used as input to an answer selection system in order to find specific answers from the extracted sentences. [CLS] [SEP] Alternatively, the sentences canbe returned to the user as a question-focused summary. [CLS] [SEP] To apply LexRank, a similarity graph is producedfor the sentences in an input document set. [CLS] [SEP] In thegraph, each node represents a sentence. [CLS] [SEP] There areedges between nodes for which the cosine similarity between the respective pair of sentences exceedsa given threshold. [CLS] [SEP] The degree of a given node isan indication of how much information the respective sentence has in common with other sentences. [CLS] [SEP] In topic-sensitive LexRank, we first stem all of thesentences in a set of articles and compute word IDFsby the following formula: [CLS] [SEP] In a Web-based news summarization setting, users of our system could choose to see the retrieved sentences (asin Table 9) as a question-focused summary.
