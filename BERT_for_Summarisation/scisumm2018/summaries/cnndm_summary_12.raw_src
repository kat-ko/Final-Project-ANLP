[CLS] [SEP] Automatic Paraphrase Discovery based on Context and Keywords between NE Pairs [CLS] [SEP] For example, in Information Retrieval (IR), we have to match a userâ€™s query to the expressions in the desired documents, while in Question Answering (QA), we have to find the answer to the userâ€™s question even if the formulation of the answer in the document is different from the question. [CLS] [SEP] Up to now, most IE researchers have been creating paraphrase knowledge (or IE patterns) by hand and for specific tasks. [CLS] [SEP] In order to create an IE system for a new domain, one has to spend a long time to create the knowledge. [CLS] [SEP] In this paper, we will propose an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus. [CLS] [SEP] The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004]. [CLS] [SEP] We are focusing on phrases which have two Named Entities (NEs), as those types of phrases are very important for IE applications. [CLS] [SEP] For each pair we also record the context, i.e. the phrase between the two NEs (Step1). [CLS] [SEP] Next, for each pair of NE categories, we collect all the contexts and find the keywords which are topical for that NE category pair. [CLS] [SEP] Hereafter, each pair of NE categories will be called a domain; e.g. the “Company – Company” domain, which we will call CC- domain (Step 2). [CLS] [SEP] For each domain, phrases which contain the same keyword are gathered to build a set of phrases (Step 3). [CLS] [SEP] Extract NE instance pairs with contexts First, we extract NE pair instances with their context from the corpus. [CLS] [SEP] The NE tagger is a rule-based system with 140 NE categories [Sekine et al. 2004]. [CLS] [SEP] These 140 NE categories are designed by extending MUC’s 7 NE categories with finer sub-categories (such as Company, Institute, and Political Party for Organization; and Country, Province, and City for Location) and adding some new types of NE categories (Position Title, Product, Event, and Natural Object). [CLS] [SEP] Cluster phrases based on Links We now have a set of phrases which share a keyword. [CLS] [SEP] At this step, we will try to link those sets, and put them into a single cluster. [CLS] [SEP] Here a set is represented by the keyword and the number in parentheses indicates the number of shared NE pair instances. [CLS] [SEP] Rather we believe several methods have to be developed using different heuristics to discover wider variety of paraphrases. [CLS] [SEP] There have been other kinds of efforts to discover paraphrase automatically from corpora. [CLS] [SEP] Another approach to finding paraphrases is to find phrases which take similar subjects and objects in large corpora by using mutual information of word distribution [Lin and Pantel 01]. [CLS] [SEP] While there are other obstacles to completing this idea, we believe automatic paraphrase discovery is an important component for building a fully automatic information extraction system. [CLS] [SEP] We proposed an unsupervised method to discover paraphrases from a large untagged corpus.
