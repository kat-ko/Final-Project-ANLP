The algorithm is based on a graph model representing words and relationships between them.
Sense clusters are iteratively computed by clustering the local graph of similar words around an ambiguous word.
This paper describes an algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from free text and maps them to the appropriate entries of existing dictionaries or taxonomies.
Based on the intuition that nouns which co-occur in a list are often semantically related, we extract contexts of the form Noun, Noun,... and/or Noun, e.g. &quot;genomic DNA from rat, mouse and dog&quot;.
Following the method in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), we build a graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur in lists more than a given number of times 1.
To detect the different areas of meaning in our local graphs, we use a cluster algorithm for graphs (Markov clustering, MCL) developed by van Dongen (2000).
The local graph in step 1 consists of w, the ni neighbours of w and the n9 neighbours of the neighbours of w. Since in each iteration we only attempt to find the &quot;best&quot; cluster, it suffices to build a relatively small graph in 1.
We then determined the WordNet synsets which most adequately characterized the sense clusters.
This gives rise to an automatic, unsupervised word sense disambiguation algorithm which is trained on the data to be disambiguated.
Preliminary observations show that the different neighbours in Table 1 can be used to indicate with great accuracy which of the senses is being used.
