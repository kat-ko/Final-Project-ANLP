Using Random Walks for Question-focused Sentence Retrieval
Our goal is to build a question-focused sentence retrieval mechanism using a topic-sensitive version ofthe LexRank method.
The output of our system, a ranked list of sentences relevant to the user’s question, can be subsequently used as input to an answer selection system in order to find specific answers from the extracted sentences.
Alternatively, the sentences canbe returned to the user as a question-focused summary.
To apply LexRank, a similarity graph is producedfor the sentences in an input document set.
In thegraph, each node represents a sentence.
There areedges between nodes for which the cosine similarity between the respective pair of sentences exceedsa given threshold.
The degree of a given node isan indication of how much information the respective sentence has in common with other sentences.
In topic-sensitive LexRank, we first stem all of thesentences in a set of articles and compute word IDFsby the following formula:
In a Web-based news summarization setting, users of our system could choose to see the retrieved sentences (asin Table 9) as a question-focused summary.
