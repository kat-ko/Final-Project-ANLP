[CLS] [SEP] Norfolk , Virginia ( CNN)The second mate of the Houston Express probably could n't believe what he was seeing . [CLS] [SEP] Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby . [CLS] [SEP] At first it looked abandoned . [CLS] [SEP] It was in bad shape , listing to one side . [CLS] [SEP] The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked . [CLS] [SEP] Incredibly , as they got closer , they saw there was a man on it , signaling for help . [CLS] [SEP] " He was moving , walking around , waving to us and in surprisingly good condition , " Capt . [CLS] [SEP] Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday . [CLS] [SEP] That man , Louis Jordan , 37 , had an amazing story . [CLS] [SEP] He 'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway , South Carolina , to fish in the ocean . [CLS] [SEP] Just a few days into his trip , a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast . [CLS] [SEP] One of his shoulders was broken , too , so he could n't fix the boat right away . [CLS] [SEP] Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail , but he could make little headway against the currents . [CLS] [SEP] " It took so long , " Jordan said .   [CLS] [SEP] " It moved so slowly . [CLS] [SEP] The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued , according to Jordan . [CLS] [SEP] His father , Frank Jordan , told CNN 's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different . " [CLS] [SEP] Had n't lost too much weight . [CLS] [SEP] He was n't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be , " he said . [CLS] [SEP] Lost at sea for 66 days . [CLS] [SEP] After his food and water ran out , it became an issue of survival . [CLS] [SEP] Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan .   [CLS] [SEP] The weather would n't cooperate . [CLS] [SEP] Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing . [CLS] [SEP] The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions . [CLS] [SEP] " I had tried to collect ( rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat , " Jordan said .   [CLS] [SEP] " The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad . [CLS] [SEP] Finally the conditions were right .   [CLS] [SEP] I filled up my water tank , which is 25 gallons .   [CLS] [SEP] I filled up a bucket . [CLS] [SEP] " Then there was the issue of food . [CLS] [SEP] The fish were n't cooperating , but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry , which he would put out to sea for a rinse . [CLS] [SEP] The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net , he said . [CLS] [SEP] Jordan came ashore Thursday evening . [CLS] [SEP] CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk , Virginia , reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. [CLS] [SEP] Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan 's incredible story . [CLS] [SEP] They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing . [CLS] [SEP] Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son 's appearance , saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time . [CLS] [SEP] His son spent most of his days in the cabin , out of the sun . [CLS] [SEP] Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low - key and private son had been through an ordeal . [CLS] [SEP] " I know he went through what he went through , " Frank Jordan said . [CLS] [SEP] Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway . [CLS] [SEP] He had free rent and free food in the river , he said . [CLS] [SEP] But when it became difficult to catch dinner , he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish . [CLS] [SEP] Frank Jordan told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son , who is an inexperienced sailor , but he held hope because his son had a good boat . [CLS] [SEP] And he had the strength to make it . [CLS] [SEP] He 's got a very strong constitution and ( is strong ) not only physically , but spiritually , " Frank Jordan said . [CLS] [SEP] " And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time , [CLS] [SEP] so I believe that sustained him a great deal . " [CLS] [SEP] Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land . [CLS] [SEP] " You would expect sunburns , severe sunburn , blisters maybe ... [CLS] [SEP] a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him , " he said . [CLS] [SEP] " But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing . [CLS] [SEP] " Grenz was also surprised by Jordan 's condition , physically and mentally . [CLS] [SEP] The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was , remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days . [CLS] [SEP] Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry . [CLS] [SEP] " We took him to a rescue boat , " the container ship captain said . [CLS] [SEP] " He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again . " [CLS] [SEP] Derriel Morris , a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year - old boat , named " Angel . " [CLS] [SEP] Morris said : " It was immaculate , it was gorgeous , beautifully painted . [CLS] [SEP] I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat . [CLS] [SEP] Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and [CLS] [SEP] Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer . [CLS] [SEP] But when he returned to the marina , Jordan had slipped away . [CLS] [SEP] " There was no shore line , no hose ; it was like he was never there , " Morris told the station . [CLS] [SEP] After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony . [CLS] [SEP] The marina 's manager , Jeff Weeks , told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week . [CLS] [SEP] Tales of people who cheated death after days , weeks adrift .
