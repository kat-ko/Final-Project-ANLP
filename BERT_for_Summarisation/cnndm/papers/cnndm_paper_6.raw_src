[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)The Rev. Robert H. Schuller , California televangelist and founder of the television ministry " Hour of Power , " died Thursday , according to his family . [CLS] [SEP] He was 88 years old . [CLS] [SEP] Schuller , also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch , had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013 , a release from " Hour of Power " said . [CLS] [SEP] " My father - in - law passed away peacefully early this morning . [CLS] [SEP] He was a great Dad and a great man of God , " said Schuller 's daughter - in - law , Donna Schuller , in a Twitter message . [CLS] [SEP] Schuller 's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc . [CLS] [SEP] He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days . [CLS] [SEP] In his autobiography , " Prayer : [CLS] [SEP] My Soul 's Adventure with God , " he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation . [CLS] [SEP] After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan , he met his wife of more than 60 years , Arvella , while preaching at her church ( she was the organist ) . [CLS] [SEP] With their young family in tow , the Schullers caravanned west to California , where he rented a drive - in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar . [CLS] [SEP] It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry , some local pastors huffed . [CLS] [SEP] The " passion pits " where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel . [CLS] [SEP] Schuller was undeterred , and he quickly outgrew the drive - in . [CLS] [SEP] He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a " miracle , " though his many mainstream critics had other names for it . [CLS] [SEP] His confident , breezy version of Christianity -- too breezy , by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed Christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post - War American preachers . [CLS] [SEP] Schuller sold a softer , gentler message , which borrowed heavily , he acknowledged , from the father of the feel - good gospel , Norman Vincent Peale . [CLS] [SEP] He preached not to convert or condemn people , but to encourage them , a sentiment he called " possibility thinking . [CLS] [SEP] " People loved it . " Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people , " said Timothy Larsen , a professor of Christian thought at Wheaton College in Illinois . [CLS] [SEP] And Schuller was a master at that . " [CLS] [SEP] " What he got right is that the gospel is good news , " Larsen continued . " [CLS] [SEP] And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope . [CLS] [SEP] " Some of Schuller 's favored phrases , though , struck others as cornpone Christianity . [CLS] [SEP] " Turn your hurt into a halo ? " said Randall Balmer , a professor of American religious history at Dartmouth College , citing one such phrase . [CLS] [SEP] " That 's pretty weak tea . " [CLS] [SEP] Still , Balmer gives Schuller some credit . [CLS] [SEP] " It may be bad theology , but it 's brilliant marketing . [CLS] [SEP] In 1970 , Schuller began broadcasting " Hour of Power , " believed to be one of the first , if not the very first , Sunday service to be shown regularly on television . [CLS] [SEP] With his genial smile , priestly robes and gray hair , he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed . [CLS] [SEP] The show , which ran for decades , reached millions , making Schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors . [CLS] [SEP] Schuller 's crowning achievement , at least architecturally , still stands in Orange County , California , though it is now owned by the Roman Catholic Church . [CLS] [SEP] The Crystal Cathedral , a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels , gave worshipers a look at the   clouds that house the heavens , while Schuller preached in the pulpit below . [CLS] [SEP] The message was clear to many : The road to the former ran through the latter . [CLS] [SEP] During the 1980s and 1990s , Schuller 's star continued to rise , with presidents stopping by the Crystal Cathedral -- often during campaigns , it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like Rick Warren and Bill Hybels seeking his advice . [CLS] [SEP] As Schuller aged , though , his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of " King Lear . "   [CLS] [SEP] He tried to install his only son , Bobby Jr. , as pastor of Crystal Cathedral . [CLS] [SEP] But the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance . [CLS] [SEP] Bobby Schuller Jr. left " Hour of Power " and the pulpit at Crystal Cathedral after a short time . [CLS] [SEP] As the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances , viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously . [CLS] [SEP] Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010 , citing debts of more than $ 43 million , according to The Associated Press . [CLS] [SEP] Schuller 's empire , which once soared as high as his glassy cathedral , had fallen to dust . [CLS] [SEP] Eventually , Schuller 's grandson , also named Bobby , took over " Hour of Power , " though at a different church . [CLS] [SEP] In a statement on Thursday , the younger Schuller recalled standing atop Crystal Cathedral 's 12-story Tower of Hope with his grandfather as they surveyed the surrounding landscape . [CLS] [SEP] " You could see the whole world from there , " he said . [CLS] [SEP] People we 've lost in 2015 . [CLS] [SEP] CNN 's Stella Chan reported from Los Angeles .
