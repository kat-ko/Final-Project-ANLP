[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)President Barack Obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with Iran even before he became the Democratic candidate for president . [CLS] [SEP] Reaching a good , solid agreement with Iran is a worthy , desirable goal . [CLS] [SEP] But the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening America 's hand and strengthening Iran . [CLS] [SEP] Obama 's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses , he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it . [CLS] [SEP] There is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the United States and not Iran that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though Iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months . [CLS] [SEP] The reason is that Obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations . [CLS] [SEP] The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal , but few people truly believe he has [CLS] [SEP] a credible Plan B. Few believe it , particularly in the Middle East and notably among America 's Arab friends , who hold the view that Iran is running circles around the United States and outplayed Obama . [CLS] [SEP] As the writer David Rothkopf aptly put it , " Iran is having a great Obama administration . [CLS] [SEP] " That 's a belief that has already started shaking up the region . [CLS] [SEP] Saudi Arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes Iran has not been stopped , and there is little doubt that other countries among Iran 's Muslim rivals will do the same . [CLS] [SEP] In fact , the notion that Obama is not handling the Iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in Yemen , where Saudi Arabia and other Arabs are trying to push back against gains by Iran 's allies . [CLS] [SEP] We can trace it all back to the Democratic primaries in 2007 , when then - Sen . [CLS] [SEP] Obama said he would meet Iran 's leaders " without preconditions , " leading his rival , Hillary Clinton , to call the idea " Irresponsible and frankly naive . [CLS] [SEP] As the years of his presidency unfolded , and the Middle East started coming apart , finding a deal with Iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement Obama might leave behind . [CLS] [SEP] The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace . [CLS] [SEP] The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after Obama 's March 31 deadline . [CLS] [SEP] The U.S.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the United States , and the French ambassador very publicly decried as a " bad tactic . [CLS] [SEP] " That bad tactic was a political move , a push to produce some sort of result , however vague , to protect the talks from critics . [CLS] [SEP] Again , a solid agreement that ensures Iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development . [CLS] [SEP] But the agreement so far does not look promising . [CLS] [SEP] It certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what Obama had vowed . [CLS] [SEP] In a presidential debate in 2012 , Obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations . [CLS] [SEP] " The deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program . [CLS] [SEP] " Nobody is talking about Iran ending its nuclear program . [CLS] [SEP] Iran will be allowed to keep one - third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges . [CLS] [SEP] That 's not a small symbolic number . [CLS] [SEP] And it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled , although Fordow will contain no nuclear materials . [CLS] [SEP] Iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses . [CLS] [SEP] The fact is that Iran has a well - established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to U.N. inspectors . [CLS] [SEP] And the U.N. agency chief says that has not stopped . [CLS] [SEP] A couple of weeks ago , with days left until the negotiating deadline , U.N. nuclear chief Yukiya Amano said Iran is still stonewalling . [CLS] [SEP] " We are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is [ for a ] peaceful purpose , " he warned . [CLS] [SEP] The negotiations ' starting point is that Iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably , forever . [CLS] [SEP] The world only learned about Iran 's secret facilities at Arak and Natanz after dissidents raised the alarm . [CLS] [SEP] Iran , we have learned repeatedly , is very good at lying to international inspectors . [CLS] [SEP] It is well - established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program . [CLS] [SEP] It is well - established that many of Iran 's neighbors do n't trust it and are anxious about the U.S.-led international dealings with Iran . [CLS] [SEP] It is well - established that Iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region . [CLS] [SEP] It is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring Iran to the negotiating table . [CLS] [SEP] It was Iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks . [CLS] [SEP] But political considerations turned the United States into the supplicant . [CLS] [SEP] The framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon . [CLS] [SEP] Nuclear enrichment will continue , although at a lower level . [CLS] [SEP] Iran officially , legally , becomes a nuclear threshold state , with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a " breakout " period of one year , the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act . [CLS] [SEP] Even the Fordow facility , conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain , will remain in existence , though " converted " to a nuclear " research facility " [CLS] [SEP] And without nuclear material on site . [CLS] [SEP] International sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately . [CLS] [SEP] Its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place , even if operating at a reduced pace , giving Iran much of what it wanted . [CLS] [SEP] With Iranian forces gaining ground in Arab lands and Iranian commanders declaring the destruction of Israel " nonnegotiable " and threatening Saudi Arabia , this deal does not look reassuring . [CLS] [SEP] Obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option . [CLS] [SEP] But the deal so far looks like ( another ) win for Iran . [CLS] [SEP] It introduces enough restrictions that it could give the President the political cover he wants , but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the Middle East .
