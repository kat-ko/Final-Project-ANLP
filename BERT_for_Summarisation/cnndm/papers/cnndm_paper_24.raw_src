[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Standing up for what you believe . [CLS] [SEP] What does it cost you ? [CLS] [SEP] Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out . [CLS] [SEP] The family - run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state 's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they 'd refuse to cater a same - sex couple 's wedding . [CLS] [SEP] " If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding , we 'd have to say no , " Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND - TV in South Bend . [CLS] [SEP] The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics , who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians .

[CLS] [SEP] Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week . [CLS] [SEP] RiskyLiberal tweeted : " Dear # MemoriesPizza . [CLS] [SEP] My boycotting your business because I do n't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion . " [CLS] [SEP] " Do n't threaten # MemoriesPizza " tweeted Aáƒ¦anda . [CLS] [SEP] " Just mock them for their ignorance . [CLS] [SEP] Bad reviews flooded the restaurant 's Facebook page , most having little to do with the quality of the food .   [CLS] [SEP] Many too vulgar to share . [CLS] [SEP] " Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens ? [CLS] [SEP] " said Rob Katz of Indianapolis .

" [CLS] [SEP] But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support .
