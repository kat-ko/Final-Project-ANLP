[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)After years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the NCAA now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered . [CLS] [SEP] On its website , the NCAA prominently states , " It 's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed . " [CLS] [SEP] And later , it says that " in the collegiate model of sports , the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first , athletes second . " [CLS] [SEP] But the NCAA is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former University of North Carolina athletes . [CLS] [SEP] The lawsuit claimed the students did n't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in NCAA history . [CLS] [SEP] In its response , the NCAA says it has no legal responsibility " to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student - athletes at its member institutions . " [CLS] [SEP] Even with pages of online information about academic standards , and even though the NCAA has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly , NCAA attorneys wrote in this court filing that " the NCAA did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student - athletes , " and " the NCAA does not have ' direct , day - to - day , operational control ' " over member institutions like UNC . [CLS] [SEP] It 's double talk , " said Gerald Gurney , a former athletic - academic director who is now president of The Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport . [CLS] [SEP] " If you look at their basic core principles , it 's all about academics , the experience , the integration of academics , and the education of the student is paramount , " Gurney said . [CLS] [SEP] " They seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths . [CLS] [SEP] The NCAA referred calls for comment to an online statement , which read in part : . [CLS] [SEP] The NCAA believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the NCAA 's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the NCAA has taken to assist student - athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field . [CLS] [SEP] " This case is troubling for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the NCAA to ensure that every student - athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them , " said Donald Remy , NCAA chief legal officer . [CLS] [SEP] In its response to the lawsuit , it also likened its role to that of the American Bar Association or American Medical Association , and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately . [CLS] [SEP] The scandal at UNC involved thousands of athletes who , over 18 years , were funneled into classes that never met , where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports . [CLS] [SEP] Mary Willingham , the UNC whistleblower turned NCAA critic , has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they 're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required . [CLS] [SEP] The system of eligibility that the NCAA brags about , she says , is a sham . [CLS] [SEP] " Why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we ca n't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway ? [CLS] [SEP] It makes no sense , " said Willingham , who recently wrote a book about the UNC scandal called " Cheated . " [CLS] [SEP] " If they ca n't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that , then why certify students semester after semester to play ? [CLS] [SEP] It 's lost its meaning for me . [CLS] [SEP] The NCAA 's claim that it 's hands - off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , Mark Emmert , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes . [CLS] [SEP] For example , before it lost a case filed by former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon , suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses , the NCAA stood on the pillar of amateurism , insisting that college athletes are paid with an education . [CLS] [SEP] That 's the defense the NCAA is now using in another class action filed by big - time sports attorney Jeffrey Kessler , seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value . [CLS] [SEP] In response , the NCAA said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education : Consistent with " its commitment to amateurism , member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with NCAA bylaws . " [CLS] [SEP] Attorney Michael Hausfeld , who represented both O'Bannon and now the UNC athletes , said this : . [CLS] [SEP] " This startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the NCAA 's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes . [CLS] [SEP] NCAA President Mark Emmert has repeatedly proposed that ' What we live for is the education of our athletes , ' but the NCAA 's record tells a far different story . " [CLS] [SEP] But Rick Burton , professor of sport management at Syracuse University , said it 's not realistic to think that the NCAA would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country . [CLS] [SEP] " I understand , I think , where the NCAA is coming from . [CLS] [SEP] We would not let the NCAA come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at Syracuse University , " he said . [CLS] [SEP] " It sounds like someone is trying to say the NCAA should have been supervising that department at the University of North Carolina , and there 's no logic to that , " he said . [CLS] [SEP] " The people who are saying the NCAA should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the NCAA . [CLS] [SEP] " UNC , which was also sued , has admitted to the fraud , but also asked for a judge to throw out the case , saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the " educational malpractice " theory does n't apply . [CLS] [SEP] UNC claims it is protected by state law . [CLS] [SEP] This is reminiscent of another NCAA reversal . [CLS] [SEP] The NCAA , which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from " dangerous and exploitive athletic practices , " now says it does not enforce health and safety rules . [CLS] [SEP] In fact , in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 , the NCAA wrote : " The NCAA denies that it has a legal duty to protect student - athletes . " [CLS] [SEP] A CNN investigation found that the NCAA has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken . [CLS] [SEP] It has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the NFL . [CLS] [SEP] Ramogi Huma , president of the National College Players Association , and a leading thorn in the NCAA 's side for decades , said this latest backpedaling from the NCAA leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all . [CLS] [SEP] " There 's nothing left the NCAA can claim it does [CLS] [SEP] that is beneficial to college athletes or society . [CLS] [SEP] One has to wonder what does the NCAA do if it does n't protect players ? [CLS] [SEP] If it does n't play a role in the education of college athletics ? [CLS] [SEP] It begs the question of why does the NCAA exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption . "
