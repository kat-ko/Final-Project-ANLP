[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)The world 's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this . [CLS] [SEP] The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two - year shutdown . [CLS] [SEP] After problems that delayed the restart in March , scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) completed final tests , enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC 's 17 mile ( 27 km ) ring . " [CLS] [SEP] Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN 's here for , " CERN Director - General Rolf Heuer said on the organization 's website . [CLS] [SEP] " Today , CERN 's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC . [CLS] [SEP] The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles ( more than 10 billion kilometers ) -- [CLS] [SEP] the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again . [CLS] [SEP] At near light - speed , a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second . [CLS] [SEP] It took thousands of scientists , engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator , housed in a tunnel between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountain range . [CLS] [SEP] The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the " Big Bang " -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe . [CLS] [SEP] By replicating the energy density and temperature , scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved . [CLS] [SEP] Our current , limited , knowledge is based on what 's called The Standard Model of particle physics .   [CLS] [SEP] " But we know that this model is not complete , " Dr. Mike Lamont , operations group leader at the LHC , told CNN in March . [CLS] [SEP] The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy , while others have no mass at all ; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity ; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy , since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe . [CLS] [SEP] The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter , despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang . [CLS] [SEP] CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature . [CLS] [SEP] The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros ( about $ 3.3 billion ) , paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non - member nations . [CLS] [SEP] The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by Swiss and French laws and a European Council Directive . [CLS] [SEP] Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown . " [CLS] [SEP] After two years of effort , the LHC is in great shape , " said CERN Director for Accelerators and Technology , Frédérick Bordry . [CLS] [SEP] " But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels . [CLS] [SEP] " Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report .
