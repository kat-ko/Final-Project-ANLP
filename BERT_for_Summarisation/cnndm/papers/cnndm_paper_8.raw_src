[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)If you 've been following the news lately , there are certain things you doubtless [CLS] [SEP] know about Mohammad Javad Zarif . [CLS] [SEP] He is , of course , the Iranian foreign minister . [CLS] [SEP] He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry 's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks . [CLS] [SEP] And he received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning . [CLS] [SEP] " Long live Zarif , " crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street . [CLS] [SEP] You may well have read that he is " polished " and , [CLS] [SEP] unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues , " jovial . " [CLS] [SEP] An Internet search for " Mohammad Javad Zarif " and " jovial " yields thousands of results . [CLS] [SEP] He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . [CLS] [SEP] But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well - known . [CLS] [SEP] In September 2013 , Zarif tweeted " Happy Rosh Hashanah , " referring to the Jewish New Year . [CLS] [SEP] That prompted Christine Pelosi , the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , to respond with a tweet of her own : " [CLS] [SEP] The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran 's Holocaust denial , sir . " [CLS] [SEP] And , perhaps to her surprise , Pelosi got a response . [CLS] [SEP] " Iran never denied it , " Zarif tweeted back . [CLS] [SEP] " The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . [CLS] [SEP] " The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . [CLS] [SEP] Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad 's successor , Hassan Rouhami . [CLS] [SEP] His foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that " due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the United States . [CLS] [SEP] " That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran , which began in 1977 , and during the Iranian Revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . [CLS] [SEP] Zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988 . [CLS] [SEP] Both of his children were born in the United States . [CLS] [SEP] The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry , which Zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . [CLS] [SEP] The first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran , says Zarif was " born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959 . [CLS] [SEP] " Later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as January 8 , 1960 . [CLS] [SEP] And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . [CLS] [SEP] So he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . [CLS] [SEP] Whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , Kerry , who is 71 . [CLS] [SEP] The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation , a charitable organization . [CLS] [SEP] The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions . [CLS] [SEP] But last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government , did not mention Zarif 's name . [CLS] [SEP] Early in the Iranian Revolution , Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco . [CLS] [SEP] The aim , says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif 's memoirs , titled " Mr. Ambassador " -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic . [CLS] [SEP] Later , the website says , Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations . [CLS] [SEP] In response , the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job . [CLS] [SEP] In fact , he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . [CLS] [SEP] And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland .
