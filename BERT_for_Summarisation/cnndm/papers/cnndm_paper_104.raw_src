[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Rebekah Gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict . [CLS] [SEP] It had been almost two years since Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the Boston Marathon , setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others . [CLS] [SEP] In court last month , she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street , staring at her own bones . [CLS] [SEP] Now , jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath . [CLS] [SEP] But no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain , she said . [CLS] [SEP] " I do n't believe that there will ever be justice brought to this , no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life , " she said , crying as she spoke to reporters outside her Texas home . [CLS] [SEP] " I do believe , however , that he should be held accountable for his actions . [CLS] [SEP] And I 'm very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that . [CLS] [SEP] Gregory , who wrote a widely publicized letter to Tsarnaev after testifying , said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories , but it 's an important step . [CLS] [SEP] " Everything is being brought up again full force . [CLS] [SEP] Our lives will never ever be the same , but I hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason , that there 's a bigger plan , " she said . [CLS] [SEP] " I may be standing on one fake leg , but I 'm standing here , stronger than ever , because someone tried to destroy me , and he failed . [CLS] [SEP] For Gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack , Wednesday 's verdict brought a mix of emotions , from triumphant vows to move forward , to expressions of gratitude , to debate over whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death . [CLS] [SEP] There were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in Boston . [CLS] [SEP] In fact , there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats . [CLS] [SEP] As Tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head , some survivors and victims ' family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears . [CLS] [SEP] As CNN 's Alexandra Field noted from inside the courtroom , " They 've waited a long time for this . " [CLS] [SEP] The family of Sean Collier , a 26-year - old police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said Tsarnaev and his brother , Tamerlan , were terrorists who " failed monumentally " in striking fear in people . [CLS] [SEP] While today 's verdict can never bring Sean back , we are thankful that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families , " the Collier family said in a written statement . [CLS] [SEP] To Richard " Dic " Donohue , an MBTA police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the Tsarnaevs in Watertown , the verdicts show that " as a society , ... terrorism will not prevail , and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation . " [CLS] [SEP] " Justice has been served today , " Donahue tweeted . [CLS] [SEP] Survivor Karen Brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal . [CLS] [SEP] She does n't believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 's brother Tamerlan , now dead , persuaded him to take part in the plot , as the defense contended . [CLS] [SEP] Dzhokhar , in her view , was " all in . " [CLS] [SEP] " Obviously we are grateful for the outcome today , " Brassard tolder reporters . [CLS] [SEP] " It 's not a happy occasion , but it 's something that we can put one more step behind us . [CLS] [SEP] " That sense of turning the page was echoed by Bruce Mendelsohn , who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line . [CLS] [SEP] The verdicts mean that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect -- he is now officially a " convicted killer . [CLS] [SEP] " You ca n't call it celebration . [CLS] [SEP] But there is a newfound peace of mind , at least , in and around Boston . [CLS] [SEP] This was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt . [CLS] [SEP] And they got through it by rallying around each other , a deep bond reflected in the mantra " Boston Strong . [CLS] [SEP] That feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by Wednesday 's verdict . [CLS] [SEP] And it 's evident in people like Heather Abbott , who lost her left leg below the knee . [CLS] [SEP] Since then , she 's become a living example of someone who was n't stopped by the terror -- learning not only to walk again , but to run again . [CLS] [SEP] " Nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever , " Abbott said Wednesday on Facebook . " [CLS] [SEP] But at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken . [CLS] [SEP] That view was commonly shared . [CLS] [SEP] For those hurt -- physically , mentally , emotionally -- by the horrors of 2013 , Wednesday was key to their progression . [CLS] [SEP] But it 's not the end of the road . [CLS] [SEP] The picture of him , bloodied , being rushed through the streets of Boston by good Samaritan Carlos Arredondo , became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack . [CLS] [SEP] Even after losing both his legs , Bauman has become a symbol since of resilience -- moving on with his life , by marrying and fathering a child . [CLS] [SEP] On Wednesday , Bauman said the verdict " will never replace the lives that were lost and so dramatically changed . " [CLS] [SEP] " But it is a relief , " he added , " and one step closer to closure . " [CLS] [SEP] CNN 's Ann O'Neill and Steve Almasy contributed to this report .
