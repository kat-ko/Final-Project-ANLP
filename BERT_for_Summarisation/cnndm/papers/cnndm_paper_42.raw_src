' [CLS] [SEP] the Hot 100 's No . 1 Song of 2015 ? [CLS] [SEP] With " Funk " now just three weeks from potentially tying " One Sweet Day " for the record , and four weeks from possibly claiming it all to itself , can it rewrite Hot 100 history ? [CLS] [SEP] It 's too early to forecast charts a month away , but " Funk " still sports strong leads in all main Hot 100 metrics . [CLS] [SEP] " Funk " logs a 13th week atop the Digital Songs chart with 165,000 downloads sold ( down 12 percent ) in the week ending March 29 , according to Nielsen Music .   [CLS] [SEP] That 's a record - tying feat : " Funk ! " [CLS] [SEP] matches Flo Rida 's 2007 - 08 hit " Low , " featuring T - Pain , for the most weeks a title has spent at No . 1 on Digital Songs . [CLS] [SEP] " Funk " also leads Streaming Songs ( 16.2 million U.S. streams , down 15 percent ) for an 11th week . [CLS] [SEP] On Radio Songs , " Funk " reigns for a 10th week with 166 million in all - format audience ( down 4 percent ) . [CLS] [SEP] It 's the first song to reach double - digit weeks at No . 1 on Radio Songs since " Blurred Lines " led for 11 . [CLS] [SEP] Ask Billboard : Will ' Uptown Funk ! ' [CLS] [SEP] the Hot 100 's No . 1 Song of 2015 ? [CLS] [SEP] " Funk , " thus , leads the Hot 100 and its three main component charts ( Digital Songs , Radio Songs and Streaming Songs ) simultaneously for a record - extending ninth week ( nonconsecutively ) . [CLS] [SEP] Perhaps helping the chances that " Funk " can remain at No . 1 on the Hot 100 , at least for another week : while it 's down by 11 percent in overall activity , the No . 2 song ( for a third week ) , Maroon 5 's " Sugar , " decreases by 3 percent , while Ed Sheeran 's " Thinking Out Loud , " at No . 3 [CLS] [SEP] ( for a third week , after peaking at No . 2 for eight weeks ) , is off by 2 percent . [CLS] [SEP] And , the lead of " Funk " over those songs is still significant : they each boast approximately two - thirds of the Hot 100 points of " Funk " this week . [CLS] [SEP] Could either " Sugar " or " Loud " rebound to challenge " Funk " further on the Hot 100 ? [CLS] [SEP] Could another song in the top 10 topple it ? [CLS] [SEP] Or , is it a song just building , or not even yet released , that will take over ? [CLS] [SEP] Again , it 's too soon to tell . [CLS] [SEP] We know only that a song will eventually dethrone the uncommonly overarching smash that " Funk " has become . [CLS] [SEP] ( At least we think one will ... ) [CLS] [SEP] Taylor Swift 's ' Style ' hits No . 1 on adult pop songs . [CLS] [SEP] Meanwhile , " Sugar " takes over at No . 1 on the subscription services - based On - Demand Songs chart , despite a 10 percent drop to 4.1 million streams . [CLS] [SEP] ( " Funk " falls to No . 3 on the list after 11 weeks at No . 1 . ) [CLS] [SEP] " Sugar " holds at No . 2 on Digital Songs ( 143,000 , down 8 percent ) ; rises 4 - 2 on Radio Songs ( 133 million , up 3 percent ) ; and keeps at No . 4 on Streaming Songs ( 9.5 million , down 4 percent ) . [CLS] [SEP] Below Sheeran , Ellie Goulding 's " Love Me [CLS] [SEP] Like You Do " holds at No . 4 on the Hot 100 after reaching No . 3 . [CLS] [SEP] The Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack single dips 3 - 4 on Digital Songs ( 114,000 , down 14 percent ) and stays at No . 5 on Radio Songs ( 118 million , up 8 percent ) and Streaming Songs ( 9 million , up 9 percent ) . [CLS] [SEP] From the same hit movie , The Weeknd 's " Earned It ( Fifty Shades of Grey ) " reaches the Hot 100 's top five ( 6 - 5 ) , adding top Airplay Gainer honors for a second week . [CLS] [SEP] On Radio Songs , it pushes 9 - 6 with a 23 percent gain to 86 million . [CLS] [SEP] " Earned " ( a possible contender for No . 1 on the Hot 100 ... ) holds at No . 6 on both Streaming Songs ( 8.9 million , up 24 percent ) and Digital Songs ( 107,000 , up 4 percent ) . [CLS] [SEP] The sultry track also takes over at No . 1 on Billboard 's Hot R&B / [CLS] [SEP] Hip - Hop Songs chart . [CLS] [SEP] Taylor Swift 's ' Style ' Hits [CLS] [SEP] No . 1 on Adult Pop Songs . [CLS] [SEP] Fetty Wap 's " Trap Queen " rises 8 - 6 on the Hot 100 , while spending a second week at No . 1 on Hot Rap Songs ; Taylor Swift 's " Style " ranks at No . 7 on the Hot 100 for a third week after reaching No . 6 [CLS] [SEP] ( and , as previously reported , reaches No . 1 on the Adult Pop Songs airplay chart ) ; Rihanna , Kanye West and Paul McCartney 's " FourFiveSeconds " drops 5 - 8 on the Hot 100 after climbing to No . 4 ( and departs the Hot R&B / [CLS] [SEP] Hip - Hop Songs summit after seven weeks ) ; and Flo Rida climbs 10 - 9 with " G.D.F.R. , " featuring Sage the Gemini and Lookas . [CLS] [SEP] The rapper 's new EP , My House , arrives Tuesday ( April 7 ) . [CLS] [SEP] One song is new to the Hot 100 's top 10 [CLS] [SEP] La Rose 's " Somebody , " featuring Jeremih ( 13 - 10 ) . [CLS] [SEP] The Dutch singer 's debut hit lifts 10 - 8 on Radio Songs ( 73 million , up 9 percent ) ; backtracks 13 - 14 on Digital Songs , but with a 7 percent gain to 68,000 ; and zooms 31 - 19 on Streaming Songs ( 4.3 million , up 5 percent ) . [CLS] [SEP] The track tops the Rhythmic Songs airplay chart for a second week . [CLS] [SEP] ( Jeremih scores his fourth Hot 100 top 10 , and first in a featured role . ) [CLS] [SEP] La Rose is adjacent to her friend , and mentor , Flo Rida , on the Hot 100 . [CLS] [SEP] After she had introduced herself to him at a party , they soon began working together , and she started touring with him . [CLS] [SEP] They created " Somebody , " based on Whitney Houston 's 1987 Hot 100 No . 1 [CLS] [SEP] " I Wanna Dance With Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) , " as La Rose is a " huge fan of ' 80s music , " as she told Billboard . [CLS] [SEP] She 's currently recording her debut EP . [CLS] [SEP] Just beyond the Hot 100 's top 10 , Walk the Moon 's " Shut Up and Dance " pushes 15 - 12 , and is the new No . 1 on the Hot Rock Songs chart , while Jason Derulo 's " Want to Want Me " bounds 27 - 17 . [CLS] [SEP] And , Rihanna roars in at No . 23 with " B [CLS] [SEP] Better Have My Money , " the chart 's highest debut , powered largely by its No . 5 debut on Digital Songs ( 108,000 sold since its digital retail arrival on March 26 ) .
