[CLS] [SEP] Los Angeles ( CNN)It 's more than just one state 's internal problem . [CLS] [SEP] The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union , too . [CLS] [SEP] That 's because California is a breadbasket to the nation , growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two - thirds of its fruits and nuts . [CLS] [SEP] Here 's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state , a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a mandatory 25 % cutback in water consumption in all cities . [CLS] [SEP] In 2014 , one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the California drought . [CLS] [SEP] He was often right , according to statistics gathered by Timothy Richards , agribusiness professor at Arizona State University . [CLS] [SEP] Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table : . [CLS] [SEP] • Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $ 3.88 . [CLS] [SEP] • Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $ 1.89 . [CLS] [SEP] • Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $ 3.06 . [CLS] [SEP] • Melons by 24 cents a pound to $ 1.23 . [CLS] [SEP] Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $ 2.91 . [CLS] [SEP] • Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $ 2.39 . [CLS] [SEP] Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February , overall prices are expected to rise this year , because of inflation , U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns said . [CLS] [SEP] Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5 % and 3.5 % , and vegetables between 2 % and 3 % , close to historical average increases , Kuhns said . [CLS] [SEP] Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown , thanks to a strong dollar . [CLS] [SEP] The greenback 's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation , Kuhns said . [CLS] [SEP] Moreover , the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from California to the other 49 states , she said . [CLS] [SEP] What economists do n't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought . [CLS] [SEP] Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices , she said . [CLS] [SEP] " The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter , " Kuhns said . [CLS] [SEP] " We are not sure what the exact impact will be . " [CLS] [SEP] The reality is there 's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest . [CLS] [SEP] While not as bad as California , Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- [CLS] [SEP] the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states , the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week . [CLS] [SEP] Overall , the Western drought affects more than 52 million people , the monitor says . [CLS] [SEP] As a result , consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1 % for beef and veal in 2014 , the USDA reports . [CLS] [SEP] Straining under a drought that began in 2012 , ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures , paid more for feed , and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle . [CLS] [SEP] So the cattlemen began culling their herds , Kuhns said . [CLS] [SEP] This year 's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6 % at most , still higher than the 4.1 % historical average , the feds project . [CLS] [SEP] But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought . [CLS] [SEP] " There 's other areas being affected , " Kuhns said . [CLS] [SEP] It 's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore , but let 's face it : the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason . [CLS] [SEP] Its year - round sunshine . [CLS] [SEP] So the next time you take a holiday in California , you 'll find a few changes around here , thanks to the drought . [CLS] [SEP] Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant . [CLS] [SEP] You wo n't find water waiting for you on the table . [CLS] [SEP] Eateries now " can only serve water to customers on request , " the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations . [CLS] [SEP] Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily . [CLS] [SEP] These requests are mandatory under the new regulations . [CLS] [SEP] And they 'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains . [CLS] [SEP] Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared , many ski resorts shut down early this year , including at Lake Tahoe , and some are now building zip lines , mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming , the Sacramento Bee reported . [CLS] [SEP] " If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more , the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are , " State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March . [CLS] [SEP] But what about those yummy California wines , you ask ? [CLS] [SEP] They 're only getting better -- because of the drought . [CLS] [SEP] Yes , you read that right . [CLS] [SEP] The 2014 wine grape harvest was " third in a string of great vintages this decade , " the Wine Institute says . [CLS] [SEP] " California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage , despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway , " the institute said in a statement last year . [CLS] [SEP] A mild winter and spring caused early bud break , although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years . [CLS] [SEP] Wine grapes use relatively low water , said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi . [CLS] [SEP] " Yes , drought years tend to produce terrific quality , " she added . [CLS] [SEP] " With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , there is a good supply of California wine . [CLS] [SEP] " That may be the only thing to toast about this drought .
