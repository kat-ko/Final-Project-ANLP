[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)You may know Mindy Kaling from Fox 's cult hit comedy " The Mindy Project , " in which she plays Mindy Lahiri , a perky , quirky OB / GYN juggling her career and love life in New York . [CLS] [SEP] ( Only in the Big Apple can a doctor not afford an apartment ! ) [CLS] [SEP] The show was a breakthrough for on - screen representation — the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color — and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015 - 16 season . [CLS] [SEP] Recently , however , Kaling 's brother Vijay Chokalingam unveiled a project of his own , and while it has been getting a lot of attention , it has n't generated quite as many laughs — either from observers or from his famous sibling , who told him it brought " shame upon their family . [CLS] [SEP] " You see , Chokalingam revealed that , as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago , he engaged in a daring ( his view ) or ridiculous and offensive ( pretty much everyone else ) scam : [CLS] [SEP] He applied to medical school claiming to be African - American . [CLS] [SEP] Chokalingam had spent his college years as a " hard - partying frat boy , " and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 GPA . [CLS] [SEP] Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options , he realized that fellow Indian - Americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice — but that " black , Hispanic , and Native American applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance . " [CLS] [SEP] This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man , both to " dramatically improve " his chances of admission , and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools . [CLS] [SEP] To accomplish this goal , Chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks , trimmed his " long Indian - American eyelashes , " checked " black " under the optional race / ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname " JoJo . " [CLS] [SEP] He received invitations for in - person interviews at 11 schools , results that he claims support the notion that African - Americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or Asians . [CLS] [SEP] And now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired , he 's looking to write a book on his experiences , titled " Almost Black : [CLS] [SEP] The True Story of an Indian American Who Got Into Medical School Pretending to Be an African American . [CLS] [SEP] " What 's truly curious is that even if you agree with Chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of " systematic racism , " [CLS] [SEP] when all is said and done , it offers very little evidence of the " privilege " that he claims is accorded to black , Hispanic and Native American candidates . [CLS] [SEP] Chokalingam had mediocre grades and MCATs , but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation . [CLS] [SEP] Yet even while representing himself as black , Chokalingam received only a single admission offer , to St. Louis University 's School of Medicine , which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings . [CLS] [SEP] Harvard , University of Pennsylvania , Columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him . [CLS] [SEP] Meanwhile , he admits , pretending to be black came with disadvantages . [CLS] [SEP] He found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops — who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost , implying that he must have stolen it . [CLS] [SEP] These acts of very real prejudice , experienced regularly by blacks and Hispanics of all backgrounds — multimillionaire comedian Chris Rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason — did n't seem to dissuade Chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision - making . [CLS] [SEP] It 's not just a matter of what individual applicants " deserve . [CLS] [SEP] " One - third of Americans are black , Hispanic or Native American ; just one in 10 physicians are . [CLS] [SEP] Since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities , this lack of diversity has produced " doctor deserts , " in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians . [CLS] [SEP] Years ago , when I told my father — a doctor from a long line of doctors — that I did n't want to follow in his footsteps , he told me that was fine , because medicine is a service trade , and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession . [CLS] [SEP] A medical degree is n't a reward to be earned , he said , but a responsibility to be accepted . [CLS] [SEP] Which really cuts to the heart of what 's so sad about Chokalingam 's racial farce . [CLS] [SEP] Like others who 've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities — including putative presidential candidate Jeb Bush , who registered himself as " Hispanic " on a 2009 voter form , and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed Native American ancestry in the past — Chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people 's burden . [CLS] [SEP] Race is n't just about color or blood ; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present - day condition of a community of people . [CLS] [SEP] Many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive ; others are deeply painful . [CLS] [SEP] Affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation 's history ; an imperfect one , but necessary . [CLS] [SEP] There are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own . [CLS] [SEP] Industries like health care and Hollywood . [CLS] [SEP] Because what 's most ironic about Chokalingam 's decision to ride on his sister 's coattails in telling his story : While Asians are well represented in medicine , our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world , and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like Mindy Kaling , it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces , voices and stories . [CLS] [SEP] Kaling 's immense talent and charisma made her a star . [CLS] [SEP] But it was a quota - based affirmative action initiative -- NBC 's Diversity Writers Program -- that gave her a start .
