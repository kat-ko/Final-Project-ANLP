[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)This is the end . [CLS] [SEP] Beautiful friend , the end . [CLS] [SEP] For the 1960s , the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the Rolling Stones ' Altamont fiasco in December 1969 , the Kent State shootings in May 1970 or Richard Nixon 's 1972 re - election . [CLS] [SEP] For " Mad Men , " the " end of an era , " as its slogan has it , begins Sunday . [CLS] [SEP] Over the past eight years , the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric , if never a huge ratings hit . [CLS] [SEP] Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been " Mad Men " cocktails and " Mad Men " museum exhibits and even " Mad Men " presidential references . [CLS] [SEP] Don Draper , the creative director played by Jon Hamm , has become a symbol of the times -- his and , sometimes , ours . [CLS] [SEP] Its subjects have taken the show to heart . [CLS] [SEP] In March , a " Mad Men " bench was unveiled in front of New York 's Time & Life Building , where the fictional firm of Sterling Cooper & Partners has its headquarters . [CLS] [SEP] The end of a TV series brings with it some risk . " [CLS] [SEP] The Sopranos , " " Mad Men " creator Matthew Weiner 's former employer , divided fans with its famous cut - to - black finale . [CLS] [SEP] On the other hand , " Mad Men 's " former AMC stablemate , " Breaking Bad , " was saluted for an almost perfect landing . [CLS] [SEP] Speaking of landings : The last season -- technically , the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969 . [CLS] [SEP] Though Weiner and his cast have been typically tight - lipped -- Weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it 's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward . [CLS] [SEP] What 's going to happen ? [CLS] [SEP] Here are some educated guesses . [CLS] [SEP] With the ' 60s screaming towards their conclusion , " Mad Men " probably wo n't jump ahead much . [CLS] [SEP] The latter half of 1969 included the Manson murders , the Woodstock festival , a New York mayoral campaign and the Vietnam War moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with , if only tangentially . [CLS] [SEP] The show might even mention the Miracle Mets . [CLS] [SEP] It would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency 's late Lane Pryce . [CLS] [SEP] Of course , Weiner might have a different idea ; he 's from Baltimore . [CLS] [SEP] Mad Men " is generally a show about disintegration , reflective of the ' 60s themselves . [CLS] [SEP] The old orders are falling apart : white - shoe WASP firms like Sterling Cooper giving way to the ethnic pace - setters such as Doyle Dane Bernbach ; grimy New York replaced by sunny Los Angeles ; the " Good War " generation butting heads with the " Make Love , Not War " cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid - state IBM world . [CLS] [SEP] It 's all an ad agency can do to keep up . [CLS] [SEP] Last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil , thanks to the ill - fitting merger between Sterling Cooper and former rival Cutler Gleason and Chaough . [CLS] [SEP] Though the agency survived , it 's now without Bert Cooper ( Robert Morse ) and under the ownership of ( real - life ) [CLS] [SEP] Madison Avenue titan McCann Erickson . [CLS] [SEP] That 's not a recipe for long - term survival , and expect a number of longtime characters -- Ken Cosgrove ( Aaron Staton ) , Harry Crane ( Rich Sommer ) and perhaps even Joan Harris ( Christina Hendricks ) -- to look for an exit . [CLS] [SEP] Roger Sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by John Slattery -- might find an exit as well , but not one he 's anticipating . [CLS] [SEP] He 's suffered two heart attacks . [CLS] [SEP] He 's never grown up . [CLS] [SEP] Bet on a sudden and shocking departure . [CLS] [SEP] On the other hand , Peggy Olson 's star has continued to rise ( much like one of the character 's models , advertising wunderkind Mary Wells Lawrence ) . [CLS] [SEP] She left Sterling Cooper once ; indeed , she would n't have returned if her new agency had n't merged with her old one . [CLS] [SEP] If Olson , played by Elisabeth Moss , bolts the firm , it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married . [CLS] [SEP] That is , if she 's still interested in such an old - fashioned tradition . [CLS] [SEP] In recent seasons , Don 's ex - wife , Betty ( January Jones ) , has lost herself amid all the turmoil . [CLS] [SEP] She sees herself through the eyes of her spouses , and though husband Henry Francis ( Christopher Stanley ) has been far more supportive than Don , he 's a busy man . [CLS] [SEP] And Sally , Don 's daughter ( Kiernan Shipka ) , is proving to be a handful . [CLS] [SEP] On the one hand , she 's obviously bright ; on the other , she 's a teenager and starting to rebel . [CLS] [SEP] In recent seasons she 's run away and started sneaking cigarettes , and she 's always fighting with her mother . [CLS] [SEP] You could see her hitchhiking to Woodstock , or at least dropping out of school . [CLS] [SEP] Anything 's possible , but given all that the character has been through -- divorces , affairs , office politics , morose late - night rides with Glen Bishop -- it 's a bit on the nose , is n't it ? [CLS] [SEP] : It 's April 1 , 1970 . [CLS] [SEP] Richard Nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television , reminding Don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the Lucky Strike campaign that began the series . [CLS] [SEP] No fool , he had seen this day coming years before . [CLS] [SEP] He 'll fix himself a drink , ponder buying an avocado - colored refrigerator , clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived : on top of the zeitgeist , unable to accept his past and utterly , inscrutably alone .
