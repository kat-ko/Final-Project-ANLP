[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)It 's the kind of thing you see in movies , like Robert Redford 's role in " [CLS] [SEP] All Is Lost " or Ang Lee 's " Life of Pi . " [CLS] [SEP] But , in real life , it 's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days , weeks , if not months and somehow living to talk about it . [CLS] [SEP] Miracles do happen , though , and not just in Hollywood . [CLS] [SEP] We 're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard . [CLS] [SEP] Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they 'd brought aboard , if any . [CLS] [SEP] In order to survive , they ca n't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city , town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity , resourcefulness and luck . [CLS] [SEP] It 's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly , with a sailor dying at sea , except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues . [CLS] [SEP] Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says , a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts . [CLS] [SEP] Below are a few recent examples : . [CLS] [SEP] Louis Jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from South Carolina in late January . [CLS] [SEP] He headed into the Gulf Stream looking for a good spot to catch fish . [CLS] [SEP] And then everything -- his boat , his life -- turned upside down . [CLS] [SEP] Rescued man says he is ' utterly thankful ' Not only did his boat capsize , but its mast broke , Jordan said . [CLS] [SEP] And so , too , did his shoulder . [CLS] [SEP] He bought time by rationing water , then collecting fresh water in a bucket . [CLS] [SEP] As to food , Jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish . [CLS] [SEP] And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail . [CLS] [SEP] But , Jordan said , " It took so long . [CLS] [SEP] It moved so slowly . " [CLS] [SEP] His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a German - flagged container ship , the Houston Express , spotted Jordan about 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Thursday . [CLS] [SEP] After their reunion , his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads . [CLS] [SEP] " I thought I lost you . " [CLS] [SEP] Jose Salvador Alvarenga says his journey began in Paredon Viejo , a port on Mexico 's Pacific coast , in late 2012 . [CLS] [SEP] The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December , locals say it was November . [CLS] [SEP] But what 's not in doubt is that , after he left , he disappeared . [CLS] [SEP] That 's when Alvarenga interacted with humans once again , thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands . [CLS] [SEP] Castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in Pacific . [CLS] [SEP] What was supposed to be a one - day trip , he says , turned into an arduous odyssey across the Pacific Ocean , one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive . [CLS] [SEP] His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course . [CLS] [SEP] Then a storm hit causing their boat , which was about three people long and one wide , to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems . [CLS] [SEP] Four weeks in , Alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year - old Ezequiel Cordova , according to the boat 's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds . [CLS] [SEP] The days , weeks and months ran together after that . [CLS] [SEP] and , when there was n't any available , his own urine . [CLS] [SEP] Then , after 13 or 14 months adrift , he and his small , heavily damaged boat arrived on the Ebon Atoll , about a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro . [CLS] [SEP] The atoll has one phone line , no Internet service and a few residents , two of whom Alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods . [CLS] [SEP] The El Salvador native told CNN that his faith in God helped him survive . [CLS] [SEP] " I thought , ' I am going to get out , " he said . [CLS] [SEP] " Get out , get out , get out . [CLS] [SEP] Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement , reining it in a few notches as life slows down . [CLS] [SEP] And if you live in Hawaii , there 's even more reason to take it easy . [CLS] [SEP] The thing is : Ron Ingraham is n't one of those people . [CLS] [SEP] The sea is both his life and livelihood , his son , Zakary , told CNN . [CLS] [SEP] And he 's tough , with his son jokingly comparing him to Rambo . [CLS] [SEP] Still , even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what Ron Ingraham went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the Hawaiian island of Molokai . [CLS] [SEP] Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea . [CLS] [SEP] After bad weather hit , Ron Ingraham told CNN affiliate KHNL / KGMB that his 25-foot sailboat went " backwards all night long . [CLS] [SEP] " At one point , a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well . [CLS] [SEP] The 67-year - old used a rope to pull himself back in . [CLS] [SEP] But his boat could n't be rescued so easily , leaving him at the mercy of the current . [CLS] [SEP] A distress call went out , prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles . [CLS] [SEP] When a Coast Guard official told him the search was being called off December 1 , Zakary Ingraham responded , " I do n't feel like he 's dead . [CLS] [SEP] I do n't feel it . [CLS] [SEP] Twelve days after that first distress call , Ron Ingraham was picked up about 64 miles ( 103 kilometers ) south of Honolulu " weak , hungry and dehydrated " and -- most importantly -- alive . [CLS] [SEP] The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him . [CLS] [SEP] In February 2012 , two friends asked 18-year - old Adrian Vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition . [CLS] [SEP] He said yes , and the three set off from the Panama town of San Carlos on a small boat , Vasquez 's mother , Nilsa de la Cruz , recalled . [CLS] [SEP] Things started out well , by all accounts . [CLS] [SEP] The three caught plenty of fish . [CLS] [SEP] Then , their boat 's engine died without warning . [CLS] [SEP] And , with no tools and scant navigational experience , the trio did n't know what to do , according to Vasquez 's mother . [CLS] [SEP] Mother calls Panama teen 's return ' a miracle ' Vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat , the Fifty Cents , further and further from the coast and into the Pacific Ocean . [CLS] [SEP] Somewhere along the way , his two companions died . [CLS] [SEP] It 's not clear exactly how , with Ecuadorian Rear . [CLS] [SEP] Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle saying Vasquez threw their bodies into the sea " because they had become badly decomposed . [CLS] [SEP] " Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began , fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the Galapagos Islands . [CLS] [SEP] The Ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor , who 'd lost 20 pounds and showed " severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition , " according to Calle . [CLS] [SEP] He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him , but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal . " [CLS] [SEP] For us , this is an opportunity to get closer as a family , " his mother said by phone , " to be more understanding and loving . " [CLS] [SEP] Sometimes one does n't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled . [CLS] [SEP] Sometimes people do n't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end . [CLS] [SEP] For proof , look no further than Hiromitsu Shinkawa . [CLS] [SEP] 60-year - old man waves red flag to alert rescuers . [CLS] [SEP] He was at home on March 11 , 2011 , when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo . [CLS] [SEP] A devastating tsunami followed , its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors . [CLS] [SEP] By the time it had run the course , nearly 16,000 people were dead . [CLS] [SEP] Shinkawa was n't one of them . [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after the quake , he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of Minamisoma . [CLS] [SEP] His home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge , powerful tsunami wave . [CLS] [SEP] " I was saved by holding onto the roof , " the 60-year - old said , according to Kyodo News Agency . [CLS] [SEP] " But my wife was swept away . ' [CLS] [SEP] More than two days later , video showed Shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood , shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles ( 15 kilometers ) out to sea . [CLS] [SEP] He was waving a self - made red flag . [CLS] [SEP] After being spotted by crew aboard a Japanese Maritime Self - Defense Force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat , he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears , Kyodo reported . [CLS] [SEP] Shinkawa told his rescuers , " I thought today was the last day of my life . "
