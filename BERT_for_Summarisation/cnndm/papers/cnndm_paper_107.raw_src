[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Anyone who has given birth -- or been an observer of the event -- knows how arduous it can be . [CLS] [SEP] But to do it live on the Internet ? [CLS] [SEP] With two hooves sticking out for several minutes in the midst of labor ? [CLS] [SEP] Luckily , Katie -- a giraffe at the Dallas Zoo -- is a champ . [CLS] [SEP] In an hour - long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by Animal Planet , Katie gave birth to a not - so - little baby ( about 6 feet tall ) early Friday evening . [CLS] [SEP] There was no immediate word on the newborn 's gender or condition . [CLS] [SEP] But there were good signs , as seen on the live stream and Dallas Zoo 's Twitter feed -- like its ears moving , its efforts to stand , and its nursing ( or at least trying to nurse ) from mom . [CLS] [SEP] " We 're so proud , " the zoo tweeted . [CLS] [SEP] The newcomer 's debut was a long time coming , especially when you count for Katie 's 15-month gestation period -- average for a giraffe , according to Animal Planet . [CLS] [SEP] The baby joins a sister , 4-year - old calf Jamie . [CLS] [SEP] It was n't immediately known how many people online saw Katie go into labor and give birth . [CLS] [SEP] But the giraffe definitely did have watchers in the form of fellow giraffes who saw the scene unfold from an abutting barn , one of them being Katie 's BFF Jade . [CLS] [SEP] The fact that the spunky Katie held up so well under the spotlight is n't a total shocker .   [CLS] [SEP] The zoo describes her as the " diva " among a herd of 12 giraffes at the zoo who loves to " toss her head around " when she does n't like something . [CLS] [SEP] As Animal Planet noted , " She 's one of the only giraffes at the Dallas Zoo who can stick her long tongue out on cue . " [CLS] [SEP] CNN 's Justin Lear contributed to this report .
