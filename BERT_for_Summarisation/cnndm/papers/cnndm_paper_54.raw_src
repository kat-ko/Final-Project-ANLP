[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)The FBI has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists , the Malaysian bomb maker known as Marwan , was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the Philippines in January . [CLS] [SEP] Marwan , whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir , was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah 's central command . [CLS] [SEP] The FBI said in February that a DNA sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern Philippines showed a link with a known relative of Marwan . [CLS] [SEP] But the FBI now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted Islamic extremist . [CLS] [SEP] After a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our Philippine law enforcement partners , the FBI has assessed that terrorism subject , Zulkifli Abdhir [CLS] [SEP] ... is deceased and has been removed from the FBI 's list of Most Wanted Terrorists , " David Bowdich , assistant director in charge of the FBI 's Los Angeles field office , told CNN in a statement . [CLS] [SEP] The FBI had been offering a $ 5 million reward for information leading to Marwan 's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court . [CLS] [SEP] It accused him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations , and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups , including the Philippines - based Abu Sayyaf . [CLS] [SEP] Marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by Philippine security forces in 2012 . [CLS] [SEP] The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years , and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) , the largest rebel group in the region . [CLS] [SEP] But in January it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of Marwan at Mamapasono , in the southern province of Maguindanao . [CLS] [SEP] The mission went disastrously awry . [CLS] [SEP] Forty - four members of the police 's elite Special Action Force ( SAF ) unit were killed in the assault , targeting an area controlled by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters ( BIFF ) -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the Philippines government . [CLS] [SEP] According to a report released by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict ( IPAC ) last month , the BIFF faction sheltering Marwan had sworn allegiance to ISIS . [CLS] [SEP] In the immediate aftermath of the assault , the SAF company charged with executing Marwan came under fire , before another SAF company stationed in nearby MILF territory as a " blocking force " became engaged in an eight - hour firefight with MILF fighters . [CLS] [SEP] According to the IPAC report , the SAF " blocking " company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived , . [CLS] [SEP] Eighteen MILF fighters were killed and a number of BIFF fighters may also died . [CLS] [SEP] The clash shattered a three - year ceasefire with the MILF , authorities said . [CLS] [SEP] A national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest . [CLS] [SEP] Bowdich expressed the FBI 's " sincere condolences to the brave officers of the Special Action Force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive . " [CLS] [SEP] While an SAF superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it , controversy has dogged the botched mission in the Philippines . [CLS] [SEP] The IPAC report argued that the " single - minded focus " of authorities on killing Marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the MILF , which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the Philippines Congress . [CLS] [SEP] " The best chance the southern Philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy , " read the report , which argued that the Mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing Marwan . [CLS] [SEP] The report argued that , although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf , he was not " the master bomber that his reputation suggested . " [CLS] [SEP] Yet for the Philippines authorities and their U.S. allies , killing Marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the MILF to such operations , for fear of word leaking to their target . [CLS] [SEP] The report quoted an anonymous Indonesian associate of Marwan 's who described the Malaysian as " a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon . " [CLS] [SEP] Dozens of Philippine police killed in raid on ' high value ' bomb makers . [CLS] [SEP] Philippines honors 44 slain commandos with day of mourning .
