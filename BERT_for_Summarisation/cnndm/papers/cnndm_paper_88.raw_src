[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)In her 40 years living in Rochelle , Illinois , Cathy Olson had never seen a tornado that big . [CLS] [SEP] " I saw the top of the funnel cloud , and it was absolutely massive , " she said . [CLS] [SEP] She watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town Thursday , tearing up its fringes . [CLS] [SEP] Farther north , in the rural Illinois hamlet of Fairdale , one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs . [CLS] [SEP] Only the thickest branches remained standing . [CLS] [SEP] It was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns . [CLS] [SEP] But in nearby Kirkland , debris was so thick on the roads [CLS] [SEP] , responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries , fire officials said . [CLS] [SEP] On Thursday , a video surfaced on YouTube of a massive twister barreling across an open field , barely missing farmhouses and barns . [CLS] [SEP] Images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media . [CLS] [SEP] Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday . [CLS] [SEP] A   large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa . [CLS] [SEP] And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis . [CLS] [SEP] Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma , Kansas and Missouri , the Storm Prediction Center said . [CLS] [SEP] But it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive . [CLS] [SEP] Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton , Illinois . [CLS] [SEP] It could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state 's third largest city .   [CLS] [SEP] The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County , according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter . [CLS] [SEP] North of Rochelle , a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers .   [CLS] [SEP] " It 's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants , " said Eric Widick , who drove up in his truck to help out . [CLS] [SEP] " We 're a community . [CLS] [SEP] If one person is in need , we 'll all be there for them . [CLS] [SEP] " People were inside when the storm quashed Grubsteakers and turned over a semitruck parked outside . [CLS] [SEP] No one was killed or seriously injured ,   Widick said . [CLS] [SEP] Although a patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour . [CLS] [SEP] People had been eating at Grubsteakers for some 25 years and will miss it , Widick said . [CLS] [SEP] In Rochelle , the tornado flattened some of Olson 's friends ' homes . [CLS] [SEP] A safe distance away from it , at her mother 's house , she had to think about her husband , Chet , who was reelected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the day before . [CLS] [SEP] He 'd have a job ahead of him . [CLS] [SEP] " I have not been able to get a hold of him , Olson said , " [CLS] [SEP] but I know he 's in touch with the sheriff and is safe , " she said . [CLS] [SEP] Sheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in Ogle County aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable . [CLS] [SEP] The county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own . [CLS] [SEP] Fifty to 100 houses had significant damage , he said . [CLS] [SEP] Only foundations remained of some homes , said storm chaser Dan Gottschalk . [CLS] [SEP] " You can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be , " he said . [CLS] [SEP] Lindsey Clark , a reporter from CNN affiliate WREX , said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the Rochelle area . [CLS] [SEP] VanVickle was newly elected sheriff of Rochelle on Wednesday . [CLS] [SEP] On Thursday , the storm took his house and his sister - in - law 's . [CLS] [SEP] " I 've got the clothes on my back , " he said . [CLS] [SEP] But his family was n't at home when it hit . [CLS] [SEP] " My family was on the way to Louisville , dog was in the basement and she survived . [CLS] [SEP] " It was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county . [CLS] [SEP] " I 've lived here all my life , am the fifth generation in the county .   [CLS] [SEP] My mom said this is the first time she 's ever seen a tornado . [CLS] [SEP] He is thankful that the National Weather Service warned one could come . [CLS] [SEP] That saved lives , he believes .
