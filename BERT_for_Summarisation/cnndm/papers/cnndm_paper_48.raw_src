[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Blue Bell ice cream has temporarily shut down one of its manufacturing plants over the discovery of listeria contamination in a serving of ice cream originating from that plant . [CLS] [SEP] Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell - branded products made at the company 's Broken Arrow , Oklahoma , plant . [CLS] [SEP] That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O , P , Q , R , S or T behind the coding date . [CLS] [SEP] The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream , including other 3-ounce servings , not made at the plant . [CLS] [SEP] But Blue Bell has recalled other products . [CLS] [SEP] The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility " out of an abundance of caution " to search for a possible cause of contamination . [CLS] [SEP] It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company 's ice cream . [CLS] [SEP] Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital . [CLS] [SEP] The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014 , Blue Bell said . [CLS] [SEP] And , according to the CDC , listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant . [CLS] [SEP] The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically , the CDC said . [CLS] [SEP] But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak . [CLS] [SEP] In a separate outbreak in Texas , the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples . [CLS] [SEP] None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections . [CLS] [SEP] " Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing , " the CDC said . [CLS] [SEP] In early March , in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak , Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas . [CLS] [SEP] It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall . [CLS] [SEP] Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products , according to the CDC . [CLS] [SEP] All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis , the CDC said . [CLS] [SEP] At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection . [CLS] [SEP] " We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this , " Paul Kruse , Blue Bell CEO and president , said in a statement . [CLS] [SEP] " Quality and safety have always been our top priorities . [CLS] [SEP] We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected . [CLS] [SEP] The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away . [CLS] [SEP] In a statement on its website , Blue Bell said " this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons , pints , quarts , 3 gallons or other 3 oz . cups . [CLS] [SEP] " This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries , the company said . [CLS] [SEP] Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria , and primarily affects the elderly , pregnant women , newborns and people with weakened immune systems , according to the CDC . [CLS] [SEP] Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches , sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms . [CLS] [SEP] In the United States , an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year , and approximately 16 % of these illnesses result in death . [CLS] [SEP] Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters .
