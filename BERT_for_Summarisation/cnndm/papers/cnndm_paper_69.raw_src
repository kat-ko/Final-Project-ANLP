[CLS] [SEP] Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates ( [CLS] [SEP] CNN)Lost luggage after a long flight is a common , frustrating occurrence of modern air travel . [CLS] [SEP] And sometimes , airlines lose things that are irreplaceable . [CLS] [SEP] American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City : her 2-year - old pet cat , Felix . [CLS] [SEP] Stewart said that she and her husband , Joseph Naaman , booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1 . [CLS] [SEP] Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening , Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport , according to Etihad Airways . [CLS] [SEP] Felix was able to get loose , Stewart said she believes , because the cat 's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area . [CLS] [SEP] Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat 's carrier had been crushed . [CLS] [SEP] Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat 's carrier . [CLS] [SEP] At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed . [CLS] [SEP] Nearly one week later , Felix remains missing . " [CLS] [SEP] For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo , not a live animal , makes me sick , " Stewart said .   [CLS] [SEP] " You trust that people care and are doing the job well , and then this happens . [CLS] [SEP] " A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is " extremely rare . "   [CLS] [SEP] The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year . [CLS] [SEP] Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat . [CLS] [SEP] The Abu Dhabi - based carrier also said it hired " third - party specialists " to help in the hunt for Felix . [CLS] [SEP] " We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search , " Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement . [CLS] [SEP] " We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident , as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority . [CLS] [SEP] " Stewart and her husband booked the cat 's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years . [CLS] [SEP] The couple said they spent $ 1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight . [CLS] [SEP] " You pay all of this money , but for what ? [CLS] [SEP] People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of , but they 're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage , " Stewart said . [CLS] [SEP] It is n't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York 's busiest airport . [CLS] [SEP] In August 2011 , a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco . [CLS] [SEP] That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport . [CLS] [SEP] But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost . [CLS] [SEP] This weekend , Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit , which provided a highly trained detection dog , to help track down Felix 's scent . [CLS] [SEP] A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix 's safe return , according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . [CLS] [SEP] Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened , the Port Authority said . [CLS] [SEP] Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers . [CLS] [SEP] " We just want to find Felix . [CLS] [SEP] But I just do n't know if we will , " she said .
