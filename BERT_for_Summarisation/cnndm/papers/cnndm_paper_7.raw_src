[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives . [CLS] [SEP] A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car , apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive . [CLS] [SEP] That 's according to Washington State University , where the dog -- a friendly white - and - black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital . [CLS] [SEP] Four days after her apparent death , the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm , dirt - covered and emaciated , where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help . [CLS] [SEP] She was taken in by Moses Lake , Washington , resident Sara Mellado . [CLS] [SEP] " Considering everything that she 's been through , she 's incredibly gentle and loving , " Mellado said , according to WSU News . [CLS] [SEP] " She 's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life . [CLS] [SEP] " Theia is only one year old but the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed . [CLS] [SEP] She suffered a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved - in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe . [CLS] [SEP] The veterinary hospital 's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care . [CLS] [SEP] She 's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated . [CLS] [SEP] Donors have already surpassed the $ 10,000 target , inspired by Theia 's tale of survival against the odds . [CLS] [SEP] On the fundraising page , Mellado writes , " She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw . [CLS] [SEP] I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home . " [CLS] [SEP] She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs , Mellado adds , and wants to " make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again ! " [CLS] [SEP] Any additional funds raised will be " paid forward " to help other animals . [CLS] [SEP] Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks . [CLS] [SEP] A cat in Tampa , Florida , found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January , showed up alive in a neighbor 's yard five days after he was buried by his owner . [CLS] [SEP] The cat was in bad shape , with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye , but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society .
