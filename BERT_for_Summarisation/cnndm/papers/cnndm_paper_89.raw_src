[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Eyewitness video showing white North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager shooting to death an unarmed black man has exposed discrepancies in the reports of the first officers on the scene . [CLS] [SEP] Slager has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50-year - old Walter Scott . [CLS] [SEP] A bystander 's cell phone video , which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott , shows the five - year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away . [CLS] [SEP] Scott was hit five times . [CLS] [SEP] If words were exchanged between the men , they 're are not audible on the tape . [CLS] [SEP] It 's unclear what happened before Scott ran , or why he ran . [CLS] [SEP] The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott , who , Slager said , tried to take the weapon . [CLS] [SEP] Before Slager opens fire , the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground . [CLS] [SEP] It 's unclear whether that is the Taser . [CLS] [SEP] Later in the video , when Slager approaches Scott 's body , Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott . [CLS] [SEP] Slager is seen in the video handcuffing Scott after the shooting . [CLS] [SEP] Witness : I nearly erased shooting video out of fear . [CLS] [SEP] Feidin Santana , the witness who recorded the video , said he did n't see Scott grab Slager 's Taser . [CLS] [SEP] His account contradicts what Slager told dispatchers . [CLS] [SEP] In two interviews with NBC , Santana said that he was walking to his job in North Charleston on Saturday morning when he saw Slager chase Scott , who had been pulled over for a broken taillight . [CLS] [SEP] Santana told NBC 's Lester Holt on Wednesday that he saw the two men struggling on the ground . [CLS] [SEP] " They were down on the ( ground ) ... before I started recording , " Santana said . [CLS] [SEP] " I remember the police ( officer ) had control of the situation . [CLS] [SEP] He had control of Scott . " [CLS] [SEP] Santana said he heard the sound of a Taser being used . [CLS] [SEP] He believed Scott was trying to get away from it . [CLS] [SEP] But Scott never got the Taser or used it on the officer , Santana told NBC . [CLS] [SEP] A North Charleston Police report included brief statements from eight police officers , but not Slager . [CLS] [SEP] One officer , identified as Sgt . [CLS] [SEP] J. Gann , said in the report he was conducting a separate traffic stop about 9:30 a.m. Saturday when he heard -- apparently via radio -- [CLS] [SEP] Slager say he was " in foot pursuit " of another motorist . [CLS] [SEP] Gann said that while driving to the officer 's location , " Slager advised that he deployed his Taser and ( requested ) back up units . [CLS] [SEP] " Seconds later , Gann reported , he heard Slager tell a dispatcher , " Shots fired and the subject is down . [CLS] [SEP] " Hours after the shooting , The Post and Courier of Charleston quoted a statement from police spokesman Spencer Pryor , who said Slager attempted to use his Taser to stop a fleeing suspect .   [CLS] [SEP] The men struggled over the device , with the suspect taking the Taser and attempting to use it against Slager , the newspaper reported . [CLS] [SEP] In the police report , another officer , J. Banias , said he was heading to the scene about 10 minutes after the initial call . [CLS] [SEP] Slager asked him to " secure his vehicle at the site of the traffic stop . " [CLS] [SEP] Banias said he spoke to a passenger in the car Scott was driving . [CLS] [SEP] The passenger was ... detained and placed in the back seat of my vehicle , " the officer reported . [CLS] [SEP] The passenger 's identity was not given in the report , but the officer said in the report that the passenger was detained . [CLS] [SEP] Scott family spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed to CNN that a man was with Scott and said he is not related to the family . [CLS] [SEP] The family declined to provide any more information . [CLS] [SEP] The North Charleston Police Department is not providing additional information , citing an ongoing investigation of Scott 's killing by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division . [CLS] [SEP] Gann said when he arrived at the shooting scene , an officer identified only as Habersham " was administering first aid " to Scott . [CLS] [SEP] " I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Habersham with first aid and CPR to the driver , " Gann said in the report . [CLS] [SEP] " We continued to perform first aid and CPR until EMS arrived ... [CLS] [SEP] When EMS and first responders arrived , EMS took care over providing care to the driver , who was pronounced deceased a short time later . [CLS] [SEP] Habersham , in his account , did not mention performing CPR . [CLS] [SEP] " I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and ( directing ) the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster , " he said in the report . [CLS] [SEP] An officer identified as Sgt . [CLS] [SEP] Webb said that he requested an ambulance . [CLS] [SEP] Webb said that at 9:41 a.m. he saw Habersham " administering chest compression to the defendant . " [CLS] [SEP] Eddie Driggers was asked at a news conference this week whether CPR was performed on Scott . [CLS] [SEP] " I do not know . [CLS] [SEP] I was told that life - saving ... [CLS] [SEP] that they tried to save his life , " Driggers said . [CLS] [SEP] North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey added that not every North Charleston police officer is CPR certified . [CLS] [SEP] What we know about Officer Slager .
