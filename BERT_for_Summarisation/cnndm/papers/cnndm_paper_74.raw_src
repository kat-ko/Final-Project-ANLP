[CLS] [SEP] CNN)As aides politely tried to rush Ted Cruz from an event in Cedar Falls to one in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , on Thursday , the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him . [CLS] [SEP] Finally , after the selfies and conversations started to die down , his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall , burly man stopped him . " [CLS] [SEP] Senator , " he said , " can I pray with you real quick ? " [CLS] [SEP] " Yeah , " Cruz said , as he clasped the man 's upper arm and the two bowed their heads . [CLS] [SEP] It was one of the many moments when Cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week , as the senator from Texas hit the trail in Iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate . [CLS] [SEP] Being the only official contender in the race , Cruz drew large crowds during his two - day swing across the state . [CLS] [SEP] He 's counting on Iowa , known for its vocal and active evangelical base , to propel him forward in what 's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates . [CLS] [SEP] Cruz , himself , displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room . [CLS] [SEP] The senator regularly avoids using a podium , instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone , a scene reminiscent of a Sunday morning sermon . [CLS] [SEP] When he meets with people after events , he embraces each one 's hand with both of his , softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing Christians and their pastors . [CLS] [SEP] The past two winners of Iowa 's caucuses rose to victory with support from the Christian right , and Cruz , who announced his bid last month at the well - known Baptist school Liberty University , is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize . [CLS] [SEP] Evangelicals make up a large segment of Iowa 's Republican voter bloc . [CLS] [SEP] According to a Des Moines Register / [CLS] [SEP] Bloomberg Politics poll from January , [CLS] [SEP] 44 % of likely 2016 Republican caucus - goers said they were born - again or evangelical Christians . [CLS] [SEP] Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck GOP leadership on fiscal issues , but he showed in Iowa last week that he 's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are anxious to avoid them . [CLS] [SEP] He was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in Indiana , which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians . [CLS] [SEP] He described the outrage over the laws as " shameful " and an " assault " on First Amendment rights . [CLS] [SEP] " There are a lot of people here in Iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking , watching what has happened in the last two weeks , " Cruz said Friday night at an event in Des Moines . [CLS] [SEP] " We have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty . " [CLS] [SEP] Indiana 's ' religious freedom ' law . [CLS] [SEP] He 's more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a Christian and a pastor . [CLS] [SEP] Rafael Cruz , who 's become a celebrity among Christian conservatives , will frequently visit Iowa over the next year , Cruz told voters . [CLS] [SEP] And Cruz 's Iowa director , Bryan English , is a former pastor . [CLS] [SEP] Cruz 's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on Fox News and NBC that are pegged to Easter Sunday . [CLS] [SEP] In the ad , Cruz talks about the impact of the " transformative love of Jesus Christ " on his life . [CLS] [SEP] While neither Mike Huckabee , who won Iowa in 2008 , nor Rick Santorum , who won in 2012 , went on to win the nomination , their successes helped launch them into high - profile battles with the then - front - runners . [CLS] [SEP] And with both of them likely running again in 2016 , the competition will be stiff . [CLS] [SEP] That 's why , for Cruz , courting evangelicals is only a component of a three - pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base . [CLS] [SEP] His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction . [CLS] [SEP] He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the IRS , and , in a knock against the National Security Agency , he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President Obama " can hear every word I have to say . [CLS] [SEP] " Cruz argued Thursday that the Republican Party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the Ron Paul - Rand Paul faction of the party -- young libertarian - minded voters -- and the Santorum base -- evangelicals . [CLS] [SEP] The two blocs , he said , are " not necessarily the best of chums . " [CLS] [SEP] " If we 're going to win , we 've got to bring that coalition together , " he said in Cedar Falls . " [CLS] [SEP] And I think we can do that . [CLS] [SEP] Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels , when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election , a higher than normal turnout for the demographic . [CLS] [SEP] That number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it 's not too far off from the 56 % of the overall population that voted in 2012 . [CLS] [SEP] Still , his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who 've been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform , then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls . [CLS] [SEP] " If you look at available places for the party to expand the vote , it does n't exist in the middle , it exists in the evangelical vote , " said Rick Tyler , a top Cruz adviser . [CLS] [SEP] " It is n't a pond , it 's an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative . " [CLS] [SEP] Russell Moore , president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention , said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 [CLS] [SEP] no matter who the nominee is or what that person says . [CLS] [SEP] Moore points to hot - button topics like religious freedom issues in the U.S. , as well as increased attention to the killing of minority Christians in the Middle East and rising anti - Semitism . [CLS] [SEP] " I do n't think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith , " Moore said . [CLS] [SEP] " I think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good . " [CLS] [SEP] Later in April , voters in Iowa will see the bulk of the GOP field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition . [CLS] [SEP] While the past two winners of the Iowa caucuses -- Santorum and Huckabee -- are likely running for president again , Steve Scheffler , president of the group , argued that the field is wide open in terms of who 's going to win favor among evangelicals . [CLS] [SEP] Jeb Bush , while not popular among conservative activists , was known for his staunch anti - abortion record as Florida governor and touts his Catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views . [CLS] [SEP] Scott Walker is the son of a pastor . [CLS] [SEP] Ben Carson , the former neurosurgeon , rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the Obama administration at a national prayer breakfast . [CLS] [SEP] And other likely candidates -- from Marco Rubio to Rick Perry to Rand Paul -- have made serious efforts to court the religious right . [CLS] [SEP] " It 's up for grabs . [CLS] [SEP] It 's a clean slate regardless of if you 've run before , " Scheffler said . [CLS] [SEP] " Naturally those two ( Huckabee and Santorum ) have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past , but by and large voters are going to say , ' Let me take a good look at all of these candidates . ' "
