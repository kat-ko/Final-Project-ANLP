[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Easter is a cornerstone event in the Christian faith , but it 's surrounded by interesting quirks . [CLS] [SEP] It celebrates the completion of Christ 's mission of salvation in the Crucifixion and Resurrection . [CLS] [SEP] By dying on Good Friday , Christ atoned for the sins of others ; by rising from the grave on Sunday , Christ conquered death . [CLS] [SEP] Simple enough and reason for Christians to celebrate . [CLS] [SEP] But , like Christmas with its tree , ornaments and Santa Claus , Easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs .   [CLS] [SEP] Unlike Christmas , it does n't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events . [CLS] [SEP] And that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around Easter ? [CLS] [SEP] Here 's a journey from the Vatican to the Holy Land , around the moon and the Earth 's tilting axis , to Germany and the United States to try to explain the complex holiday called Easter . [CLS] [SEP] And you 'll learn to how to color Easter eggs with Kool - Aid . [CLS] [SEP] Let 's start at the Vatican . [CLS] [SEP] At the Vatican , Holy Week began with Palm Sunday last week and culminated in Easter Sunday Mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of Christ 's mortal life . [CLS] [SEP] Jesus rode on the back of a donkey into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday where crowds celebrated him as the Messiah and laid down palm branches in his path . [CLS] [SEP] But the crowd and the Romans turned on him in the course of the week , according to the Bible , leading to his crucifixion and resurrection . [CLS] [SEP] Rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray St. Peter 's Square on Sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by Pope Francis . [CLS] [SEP] Afterward , the Pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his Urbi et Orbi address . [CLS] [SEP] Francis lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe . [CLS] [SEP] From Nigeria to South Sudan , Iraq to Ukraine , he expressed hope that violence would end . [CLS] [SEP] Francis also does n't put on airs . [CLS] [SEP] This week he washed the feet of believers , repeating the Biblical account of a woman , a sinner , washing Jesus ' feet and anointing them with oil . [CLS] [SEP] Let 's move on to old Jerusalem , the birthplace of Easter . [CLS] [SEP] The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in old Jerusalem unifies the spot where Christ was crucified -- Calvary -- with his tomb , or sepulcher . [CLS] [SEP] On Sunday , Catholics and Armenian Christians celebrated the Resurrection there . [CLS] [SEP] In the morning , the Latin Patriarch , the Archbishop of Jerusalem , entered the basilica . [CLS] [SEP] Then mass was held followed by a procession . [CLS] [SEP] But a large group of indigenous Christians did n't join them . [CLS] [SEP] It 's not quite Easter yet in the Holy Land for Eastern Orthodox Christians . [CLS] [SEP] They 'll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine Easter 's date by a different calendar than Western Christians -- the Julian calendar . [CLS] [SEP] Which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of Easter Sunday . [CLS] [SEP] A blood moon appeared in the sky early Saturday , right between Good Friday and Easter Sunday and during Passover . [CLS] [SEP] Not completely , because the dates for both Passover -- the Jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in Egypt -- and Easter are determined by moon phases , according to timeanddate.com . [CLS] [SEP] Easter 's timing is related to Passover , because Jesus was crucified around then , according to the Bible . [CLS] [SEP] Many Jewish holidays , including Passover , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color . [CLS] [SEP] Since the timing of moon phases does n't jibe with Earth 's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- Passover 's exact date moves around -- and so does Easter 's . [CLS] [SEP] When Christian bishops first convened at the Council of Nicaea in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of Easter , so as to fairly reliably pin it to Passover : . [CLS] [SEP] It would fall on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox . [CLS] [SEP] That 's the day in March when Earth 's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length . [CLS] [SEP] But ... if the full moon fell on Sunday , Easter would be pushed down a week . [CLS] [SEP] When the West moved from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar , Orthodox Christians stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for Easter . [CLS] [SEP] In 1997 , the World Council of Churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences . [CLS] [SEP] It did n't catch on . [CLS] [SEP] But some odd Easter trappings that popped up after the Middle Ages very much have -- the eggs and the bunny . [CLS] [SEP] The bunny is an egg - laying pagan that worships the moon . [CLS] [SEP] That 's one notion of its origins , but probably not the actual one . [CLS] [SEP] German immigrants appear to have brought it to North America in the 1700s . [CLS] [SEP] German historians are not clear on its beginnings , but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682 . [CLS] [SEP] Professor of medicine Georg Franck von Frankenau described in his paper " De ovis paschalibus , " or " On Easter eggs , " a custom in the Alsace region involving a bunny and eggs , according to German public television . [CLS] [SEP] Some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the Christmas tree . [CLS] [SEP] But von Frankenau left out any explanation of how the tradition arose , leading to a number of theories in Germany . [CLS] [SEP] One common idea : During Lent , people had to abstain from eating eggs , but hens kept on laying them , so farmers boiled and preserved them . [CLS] [SEP] By the time Easter rolled around , they were practically swimming in them . [CLS] [SEP] They had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit . [CLS] [SEP] Play hide and seek with them ; color them ; give them as gifts . [CLS] [SEP] Parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the Easter eggs came from . [CLS] [SEP] If you 're coloring eggs this year , here 's an interesting tip .   [CLS] [SEP] Instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use Kool - Aid , YouTube science geek [CLS] [SEP] And it appears to work . [CLS] [SEP] Just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in . [CLS] [SEP] They turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye . [CLS] [SEP] But be careful , it stains everything else , like clothes and upholstery , Thompson warns . [CLS] [SEP] That 's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it .
