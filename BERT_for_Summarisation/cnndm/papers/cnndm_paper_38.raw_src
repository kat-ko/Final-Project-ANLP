[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Residents of central Sanaa , the Yemeni capital , have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods : Detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors . [CLS] [SEP] And fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks . [CLS] [SEP] The Saudi - led coalition smashed parts of Yemen 's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital over the weekend , senior Yemeni officials said . [CLS] [SEP] Under the rain of coalition bombs , the Houthis , who are Shiites in a majority Sunni country , still control Sanaa . [CLS] [SEP] But the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure . [CLS] [SEP] The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi - held areas , the Yemeni officials said . [CLS] [SEP] Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well . [CLS] [SEP] Yemen 's deposed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes . [CLS] [SEP] He fired his former Army chief of staff , Hussein Khairan , on Sunday . [CLS] [SEP] The firing had no practical effect , since Khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the Houthi rebels ' acting defense minister . [CLS] [SEP] Hadi is holed up in Saudi Arabia , which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him . [CLS] [SEP] Fighting has ended dozens of lives each day . [CLS] [SEP] On Monday , more than 50 people died in the port city of Aden alone , where Houthis and their allies are battling troops loyal to Hadi on the ground , Agence France - Press reported . [CLS] [SEP] Since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago , some 600 people are estimated to have been killed . [CLS] [SEP] Many more have been wounded , and tens of thousands have fled the country . [CLS] [SEP] The International Committee of the Red Cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in . " [CLS] [SEP] Otherwise , put starkly , many more people will die . [CLS] [SEP] For the wounded , their chances of survival depend on action within hours , not days , " said Robert Mardini , the ICRC 's head of operations in the Near and Middle East . [CLS] [SEP] " Medical supplies need to be here yesterday , " said ICRC spokeswoman Marie - Claire Feghali from Sanaa . [CLS] [SEP] " We need to save the lives that can be saved . " [CLS] [SEP] Saudi Arabia signed off on letting the ICRC into Yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies , the other with workers . [CLS] [SEP] But flying in will be hard , since most airlines have canceled their flights , and airstrikes have taken out many airfields . [CLS] [SEP] On Monday , the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in Djibouti , Feghali said . [CLS] [SEP] The ICRC is hoping to fly out in a day or two . [CLS] [SEP] Following the ICRC 's call , on Saturday the U.N. Security Council discussed the humanitarian situation at Russia 's behest . [CLS] [SEP] Moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine - country regional coalition . [CLS] [SEP] The meeting adjourned with no decision announced . [CLS] [SEP] One diplomat said the draft was missing key elements . [CLS] [SEP] It did n't call for the Houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity . [CLS] [SEP] Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Hadi from power . [CLS] [SEP] The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January . [CLS] [SEP] But Hadi escaped in February , fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president . [CLS] [SEP] Houthis and their allies , including those loyal to Hadi 's predecessor , then fought Hadi 's forces in the Aden area . [CLS] [SEP] Hadi fled Aden in late March , ultimately for Saudi Arabia , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city . [CLS] [SEP] The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia , a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen 's northern neighbor , and other Arab nations to intervene with force . [CLS] [SEP] The Houthis are allied with Iran , Saudi Arabia 's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf , and Riyadh does not want an proxy of Iran in power on its border . [CLS] [SEP] Complicating matters in Yemen is the fact that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or the forces loyal to Hadi -- holds sway in the country 's east . [CLS] [SEP] AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization . [CLS] [SEP] It has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail . [CLS] [SEP] Hadi 's government had cooperated with the United States to fight AQAP , but with the Houthi takeover , that arrangement has evaporated , and the terror group operates generally unchecked .
