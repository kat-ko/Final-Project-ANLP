[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat : a nearly five - minute total lunar eclipse this morning . [CLS] [SEP] Here 's how it 's unfolding : . [CLS] [SEP] It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time , when the moon began moving into Earth 's shadow .   [CLS] [SEP] For the next hour and 45 minutes , that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time . [CLS] [SEP] The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds , and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century . [CLS] [SEP] Watch it live on NASA TV . [CLS] [SEP] While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view , at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation .

[CLS] [SEP] A lunar eclipse happens when the sun , Earth and moon form a straight line in space , with the Earth smack in the middle . [CLS] [SEP] The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow . [CLS] [SEP] As the moon moves deeper into that shadow , it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color .   [CLS] [SEP] Because Earth 's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light . [CLS] [SEP] Some people have nicknamed the effect the " blood moon . " [CLS] [SEP] NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year , but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row , known as a " tetrad .
