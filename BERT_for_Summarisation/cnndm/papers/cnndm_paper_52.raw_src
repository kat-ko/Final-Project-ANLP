[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors , " ( a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia . [CLS] [SEP] The Columbia team concluded that " The failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact - checking . " [CLS] [SEP] Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication . [CLS] [SEP] The magazine 's managing editor , Will Dana , wrote , " We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout , including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students . " [CLS] [SEP] Brian Stelter : Fraternity to ' pursue all available legal action ' [CLS] [SEP] The next question is : . [CLS] [SEP] Can UVA , Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation ? [CLS] [SEP] The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that " the elements of libel are ( 1 ) publication of ( 2 ) an actionable statement with ( 3 ) the requisite intent . " [CLS] [SEP] " Actionable " means the statement must be both false and defamatory . [CLS] [SEP] Of course , the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , but also the Virginia Constitution . [CLS] [SEP] True statements can not be defamatory . [CLS] [SEP] Neither can pure statements of opinion , because they theoretically can not be either true or false . [CLS] [SEP] But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact , and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers " true . [CLS] [SEP] The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals , and not public figures ; the latter have a harder time proving defamation . [CLS] [SEP] A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person 's reputation . [CLS] [SEP] The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false , or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis , or acted negligently in checking the facts . [CLS] [SEP] At first blush , that sounds like it fits perfectly , right ? [CLS] [SEP] The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent . [CLS] [SEP] But that 's only half the battle . [CLS] [SEP] There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this . [CLS] [SEP] The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters . [CLS] [SEP] First , let 's eliminate UVA . [CLS] [SEP] The university is a public university , and therefore it is a governmental entity . [CLS] [SEP] The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government : The government can not sue for defamation . [CLS] [SEP] There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence . [CLS] [SEP] Now the fraternities , starting with Phi Kappa Psi . [CLS] [SEP] A fraternity is not an individual , but a group . [CLS] [SEP] A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were " of or concerning " the plaintiff . [CLS] [SEP] It sounds obvious , but if you 're going to say a statement hurt you , you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with . [CLS] [SEP] When the statements are about a group without naming an individual , it 's hard to say the statement is " concerning " the individual -- and groups generally can not sue .   [CLS] [SEP] For example , you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief , but that same person can not sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves . [CLS] [SEP] Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group 's individual members , for the most part . [CLS] [SEP] Like all rules , however , there are exceptions . [CLS] [SEP] If the defamatory language is about " a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group , an individual member may sue . [CLS] [SEP] " If I said , " The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals " ( they were n't ) ,   [CLS] [SEP] the individual players could sue , because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I did n't . [CLS] [SEP] Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the " small group " exception fits it perfectly : Even if the individual members were not identified by name , the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members , who have suffered by their association with the group . [CLS] [SEP] On the other hand , Rolling Stone 's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid ( after all , the membership changes somewhat every year ) , that even though the fraternity 's reputation is tarnished , the members have suffered no individualized injury . [CLS] [SEP] As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story , that 's likely a group that moves from the small category to large , and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit . [CLS] [SEP] Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook , but that such cases are rarely actually filed . [CLS] [SEP] That 's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm . [CLS] [SEP] So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter , you 're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially . [CLS] [SEP] And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits   on Facebook live in their moms ' basements and are " between jobs , " these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place . [CLS] [SEP] The UVA situation is not your run - of - the - mill defamation case . [CLS] [SEP] The university wo n't be able to sue , but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim , and they can make a tangible case for damages , then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases .
