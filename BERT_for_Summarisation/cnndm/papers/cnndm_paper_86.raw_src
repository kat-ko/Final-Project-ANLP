[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)Do you remember the talk about plans for Iraqi - led force to try to take back Mosul this spring ? [CLS] [SEP] Well , you might want to forget it . [CLS] [SEP] Nearly three months after a U.S. official said up to 25,000 Iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern Iraqi city in April or May , a senior official in President Barack Obama 's administration said Thursday that Washington is " not putting a timeframe on " a possible invasion . [CLS] [SEP] It " might be some time from now . [CLS] [SEP] Might be soon , " another senior administration official said . [CLS] [SEP] Mosul has long been the big prize in the Iraqi government 's fight -- aided by a U.S.-led military coalition , which has carried out airstrikes for months -- to defeat ISIS . [CLS] [SEP] It has also long been a source of embarrassment , considering how it fell after Iraqi troops dropped their weapons , abandoned their posts and ran for their lives when militants arrived last June . [CLS] [SEP] The senior administration officials who talked to reporters Thursday stressed the Iraqis and their allies are making progress in their fight against the group that calls itself the Islamic State . [CLS] [SEP] In fact , officials insist that ISIS has been degraded substantially thanks to a combination of air power and ground combat . [CLS] [SEP] The biggest and most recent example of this came with the recapture a few weeks ago of Tikrit , the hometown of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein that is located some 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) north of Baghdad . [CLS] [SEP] Iraqi forces aided by Iranian - backed Shiite militiamen took that northern city , the same place where ISIS allegedly massacred Iraqi troops last year . [CLS] [SEP] Still , Mosul is n't Tikrit . [CLS] [SEP] For one thing , it has a lot more people -- about a million , one Obama administration official noted . [CLS] [SEP] And it 's more important not only to Iraq , but ISIS , meaning the terrorist group has all the more reason to go all - out to defend it . [CLS] [SEP] In some ways , the campaign for Mosul has begun , according to officials . [CLS] [SEP] There are no plans for U.S. combat troops involvement in an eventual operation , they say , but airstrikes have already targeted ISIS positions in the area . [CLS] [SEP] Just because the area has been softened up some from the air , though , does n't mean a full ground assault is imminent . [CLS] [SEP] Calling for " patience , " an administration official said that winning Mosul is a complex endeavor . [CLS] [SEP] It will " take a lot of capacity , " the official said , " and some time to build . "
