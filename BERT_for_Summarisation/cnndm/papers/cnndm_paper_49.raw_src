[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)When Hong Kong police answered a call in the early hours of a Saturday morning last November , they encountered a grisly scene and an alleged crime that shocked the city . [CLS] [SEP] One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks . [CLS] [SEP] Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony . [CLS] [SEP] A former banker , 29-year - old Briton Rurik Jutting , was charged with two counts of murder . [CLS] [SEP] On Thursday , a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until [CLS] [SEP] May. Here 's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker . [CLS] [SEP] Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene , an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai , an inner - city suburb that 's home to an eclectic mix of late - night bars , residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods . [CLS] [SEP] In the early hours of Saturday morning , November 1 , police say Jutting called them to the apartment .   [CLS] [SEP] There they found a woman lying on the blood - splattered floor , later identified as 29-year - old Seneng Mujiasih . [CLS] [SEP] During a search of the apartment , officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony . [CLS] [SEP] 25-year - old Sumarti Ningsih was killed on October 27 , five days before her body was found . [CLS] [SEP] Sumarti Ningsih was from Cilacap , in Central Java , and was the mother of a five - year - old girl . [CLS] [SEP] In a statement , her cousin , Jumiati , described her as   " just an ordinary woman from Indonesia " who , like many others , was " forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes ( sic ) true . " [CLS] [SEP] " She wanted to work as professional [CLS] [SEP] so she can earn money and dignity for her family , " Jumiati wrote . [CLS] [SEP] " She is good girl and did not deserve this treatment . " [CLS] [SEP] According to the Asian Migrant Coordinating Body , Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found . [CLS] [SEP] Last year , her grieving father , Ahmad Khaliman , told Agence France - Presse that his daughter had worked in Hong Kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013 . [CLS] [SEP] She 'd since returned on two occasions , Khaliman said . [CLS] [SEP] He said the family had been shocked by her murder , and called for the perpetrator to be executed . [CLS] [SEP] " If not , I can not accept it . [CLS] [SEP] He has already taken my daughter 's life , so he has to pay with his life , " he told CNN affiliate Trans7 . [CLS] [SEP] Seneng Mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in Hong Kong but had overstayed her visa , according to the Asian Migrant Co - ordinating Body . [CLS] [SEP] Also known as Jesse Lorena , Mujiasih was from the city of Muna in Sulawesi province , in southeast Indonesia . [CLS] [SEP] Other than that , few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in Hong Kong . [CLS] [SEP] After news of their death spread , fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong 's Victoria Park . [CLS] [SEP] Around 200 people gathered to sing and pray , and lay flowers besides photos of the two women . [CLS] [SEP] The victims ' bodies were buried after being repatriated to Indonesia in November . [CLS] [SEP] Before being taken into custody , Rurik Jutting lived in the upmarket J Residence in Wan Chai .   [CLS] [SEP] He was detained at the scene , where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises . [CLS] [SEP] It 's unclear when Jutting left his job as a trader at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch ; a BoA spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past . [CLS] [SEP] Jutting 's profile on LinkedIn said he haad been employed at the bank 's structured equity finance and trading division in Hong Kong since July 2013 . [CLS] [SEP] Before that , he worked in the same unit in London for three years . [CLS] [SEP] According to the profile , Jutting previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge , between 2004 and 2008 . [CLS] [SEP] As part of the trial process , tests were conducted to determined if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea . [CLS] [SEP] The case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed .
