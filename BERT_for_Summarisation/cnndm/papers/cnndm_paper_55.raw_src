[CLS] [SEP] ( CNN)One of Tokyo 's most prominent districts has taken a small , but potentially significant step to recognizing same - sex unions in Japan . [CLS] [SEP] The government of Shibuya ward , one of the capital 's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts , passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for " partnership certificates " for same - sex couples , allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples . [CLS] [SEP] Same - sex partners who are registered with the district 's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co - sign tenancy agreements . [CLS] [SEP] Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy , such as joint filing of taxes , are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities . [CLS] [SEP] The measure was proposed in February by Shibuya 's mayor , Toshitake Kuwahara . [CLS] [SEP] While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding , proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward 's decision is a step in the right direction . [CLS] [SEP] " It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing , " Gon Matsunaka , a gay rights activist , told CNN . [CLS] [SEP] While Shibuya 's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage , the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities . [CLS] [SEP] " What is important for the LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community in Shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society , "   Matsunaka said . [CLS] [SEP] " It could be a strong driver for Shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems [CLS] [SEP] LGBT people are facing . " [CLS] [SEP] Taiga Ishikawa , Tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in Japan , told CNN the ordinance was a " big first step for the protection of human rights . " [CLS] [SEP] He called the decision " happy " but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles . [CLS] [SEP] He said that the most important part of today 's announcement is that it " should be actually put into practice , as should education for understanding ( LGBT individuals ) [CLS] [SEP] especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young . " [CLS] [SEP] Neighboring Setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following Shibuya 's lead . [CLS] [SEP] However , former councilor Ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement 's momentum for granted . " To realize equal rights for gay couples , a national law has to be made , " he said . [CLS] [SEP] While outright discrimination against the LGBT community is rare in Japan , its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage . [CLS] [SEP] Many hide their sexuality from their employers , co - workers , families and friends . [CLS] [SEP] But the tide may be turning . [CLS] [SEP] A recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4 % oppose gay marriage , but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70 % . [CLS] [SEP] An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper , which commissioned the poll , welcomed the Shibuya decision , calling it " a bold and important step forward . [CLS] [SEP] " Only traditional marriages are recognized under Japan 's constitution , but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation , according to Mari Miura , a professor of gender and politics at Sophia University in Tokyo . [CLS] [SEP] " The constitution does not rule out same - sex marriage , so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional , " Miura told Bloomberg Business . [CLS] [SEP] While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party " do n't like the idea of same - sex marriage , but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum . [CLS] [SEP] Conservative groups were vocal in their opposition , with one , known as the Network Pushing for Normalization of Education , telling the Japan Times that granting same - sex couples the same rights as all other Japanese citizens would degrade the " familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history . [CLS] [SEP] " While Shibuya 's registration system will be a first for Japan , Yodogawa ward in the western Japanese city of Osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the LGBT community . [CLS] [SEP] In 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced , and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to LGBT individuals .
