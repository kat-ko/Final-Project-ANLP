("BERT Result: Luckily , Katie -- a giraffe at the Dallas Zoo -- is a champ .<q>In an hour - long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by Animal Planet , Katie gave birth to a not - so - little baby ( about 6 feet tall ) early Friday evening .<q>There was no immediate word on the newborn 's gender or condition .\n\n Gold Summary: But there were good signs , as seen on the live stream and Dallas Zoo 's Twitter feed -- like its ears moving , its efforts to stand , and its nursing ( or at least trying to nurse ) from mom . The newcomer 's debut was a long time coming , especially when you count for Katie 's 15-month gestation period -- average for a giraffe , according to Animal Planet .\n Scores", [{'rouge-1': {'f': 0.35294117148788934, 'p': 0.375, 'r': 0.3333333333333333}, 'rouge-2': {'f': 0.059701487555135185, 'p': 0.06349206349206349, 'r': 0.056338028169014086}, 'rouge-l': {'f': 0.30088495075573657, 'p': 0.3090909090909091, 'r': 0.29310344827586204}}])
